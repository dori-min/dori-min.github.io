        <p>A book almost utterly ineffable.</p>
<a id="more"></a>
<p>Roland Barthes is often referred by Carson. My own remark are in [ ].</p>
<h1 id="How-this-book-is-constructed"><a href="#How-this-book-is-constructed" class="headerlink" title="How this book is constructed"></a>How this book is constructed</h1><ol>
<li>The description of the lover’s discourse has been replaced by its simulation</li>
<li>then, is a portrait, which offers the reader a discursive site</li>
</ol>
<p>Components: Figure - amorous feeling</p>
<h1 id="Absence"><a href="#Absence" class="headerlink" title="Absence"></a>Absence</h1><blockquote>
<p>in a single direction, expressed by the one who stays, never by the one who leaves</p>
<p><u>“I am loved less than I love”</u></p>
<p>This endured absence is nothing more or less than forget-fulness, I am, intermittently, unfaithful. This is the condition of my survival; for if I did not forget. I should die. <u>The lover who doesn’t forget <em>sometimes</em> dies of excess, exhaustion,and tension of memory</u> (like Werther)</p>
<p>in amorous absence, I am, sadly, an <em>unglued image</em> that dries, yellow, shrivels.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="Adorable"><a href="#Adorable" class="headerlink" title="Adorable"></a>Adorable</h1><blockquote>
<p>Yet the more I experience the specialty of my desire, the less I can give it a name; to the precision of the target corresponds a wavering of the name; what is characteristic of desire, <u>proper to desire, can produce only an impropriety of the utterance.</u> Of this failure of language,there remains only one trace: the word “adorable” (the right translation of “adorable” would be the Latin <em>ipse</em>: it is the self, himself, herself, in person)</p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="Affirmation"><a href="#Affirmation" class="headerlink" title="Affirmation"></a>Affirmation</h1><blockquote>
<p>Love has two affirmations. 1. mad projection of a fulfilled future 2. love’s value is ceaselessly threatened by depreciation</p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="Anxiety"><a href="#Anxiety" class="headerlink" title="Anxiety"></a>Anxiety</h1><blockquote>
<p>it is the fear of a mourning which has already occurred, at the very origin of love,from the moment when I was first “ravished.” Someone would have to be able to tell me: <u>“Don’t be anxious anymore - you’ve already lost him/her.”</u></p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="Annulment"><a href="#Annulment" class="headerlink" title="Annulment"></a>Annulment</h1><p><em>annular = ring</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Explosion of language during which the subject manages to annul the loved object under the volume of love itself: by a specifically amorous perversion, <u>it is love that the subject loves, not the object.</u></p>
<p><u>It is my desire I desire, and the loved being is no more than its tool</u></p>
<p>I sacrifice the image to the <strong>image-repertoire</strong> [a key concept]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[Suffering is a vertex, through the annual structure it reinforces itself. Even if you are trying to love it. The only way “to get out of it” is live with it.]</p>
<h1 id="Ascetic"><a href="#Ascetic" class="headerlink" title="Ascetic"></a>Ascetic</h1><p>ascetic = stoic</p>
<p>[keyword:] guilty, self-punishment</p>
<p>turn back, look at me, see what you have made of me. It is a blackmail</p>
<h1 id="Atopos-unclassifiable"><a href="#Atopos-unclassifiable" class="headerlink" title="Atopos = unclassifiable"></a>Atopos = unclassifiable</h1><p>[a- = denial, topos = place]</p>
<p>[my question: is desire classifiable?] is the lover merely a choosier cruiser, who spends his life looking for “his type”?</p>
<p>The <em>atopia</em> of Socrates is liked to Eros.</p>
<p>It is the originality of the relation which must be conquered. Most of my injuries come from stereotype: I am obliged to make myself a lover, like everyone else: to be jealous, neglected, frustrated, like everyone else. But when the relation is original, then the stereotype is shaken, transcended, evacuated, and jealousy, for instance has no more room in the relation without a site, without <em>topos</em> - without what in French we call, colloquially, “topo” - without discourse.</p>
<h1 id="Attente-waiting"><a href="#Attente-waiting" class="headerlink" title="Attente = waiting"></a>Attente = waiting</h1><p>waiting for a telephone call is thereby woven out of the unavowable interdictions to <em>infinity</em></p>
<p>[infinity would also appear later on. in vain or in ‘finity’. let’s see]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The lover’s fatal identity is precisely: <em>I am the one who waits</em></p>
<p>A mandarin fell in love with a courtesan.“I shall be yours,’ she told him,“when you have spent a hundred nights waiting for me, sitting on a stool, in my garden,beneath my window.” But on the ninety-ninth night, the mandarin stood up, put his stool under his arm, and went away.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="Cacher-to-hide"><a href="#Cacher-to-hide" class="headerlink" title="Cacher = to hide"></a>Cacher = to hide</h1><p>[keywords:] conceal the excess</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I must determine the degree of publicity I shall give to my initial anxiety</p>
<p>the signs of this passion run the risk of smothering the other. Then should I not, <em>precisely because of my love</em>, hide from the other how much I love him?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[愛が重いです。軽く訳がないもの。]</p>
<p>…hence I tergiversate [ambiguine]: I show my passion a little</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yet to hide a passion totally (or even to hide, mores imply, its excess) is inconceivable : not because the human subject is too weak, but because <u>passion is in essence made to be seen</u>: the hiding must be seen: <em>I want you to know that I am hiding something from you</em>, that is the active paradox I must resolve: at one and the same time it must be known and not known: I want you to know that I don’t want to show my feelings: that is the message I address to the other. <strong>Larvatus prodeo</strong>: I advance pointing to my mask: I set a mask upon my passion, but with a discreet (and wily) finger I designate this mask. <strong>Every passion, ultimately, has its spectator</strong>: at the moment of his death, Captain Paz cannot keep from writing to the woman he has loved in silence: no amorous oblation without a final theater: the sign is always victorious.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[I should have read this book earlier. Not because I could avoid much of my sadness, but it provides the very way to express it.]</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.proquest.com/docview/2434912?pq-origsite=gscholar&amp;fromopenview=true&amp;imgSeq=1" target="_blank" rel="external">“Larvatus prodeo” said Descartes</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>[‘Larva’ means both ‘ghost’ and ‘mask’ and ‘larvare’ means ‘to bewitch, enchant’, ‘larvatus’ being the masculine perfect passive participle of this verb. There is a pun here and the notion conveyed is of a ghost issuing from the grave, just as an actor issued masked from the sides or back of the stage.]</p>
<p>in order to hide without lying, I shall make use of a cunning preterition [= omission] I shall divide the <strong>economy</strong> of my signs.</p>
<h1 id="Cases-pigeonholed"><a href="#Cases-pigeonholed" class="headerlink" title="Cases = pigeonholed"></a>Cases = pigeonholed</h1><p>[= （假定自己被）束之高阁，不予理睬]</p>
<p>He wants to enter into a system. For the system is a whole in which everyone has his place.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To want to be pigeonholed is to want to obtain for life docile [= easy to control] reception. As support, the structure is <u>separated from desire</u> [desire, as we see, is not easily controllable]: what I want. quite simply, is to be “kept”, like some sort of superior prostitute</p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="Catastrophe"><a href="#Catastrophe" class="headerlink" title="Catastrophe"></a>Catastrophe</h1><p>two systems of despair: gentle despair &amp; violent despair.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is clear as a catastrophe: “I’m done for!”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[I like you too much till heartbreak and despair, till the only thing between as is an end.]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I have projected myself into the other with such power that when I am without the other I cannot recover myself, regain myself: <strong>I am lost, forever.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>[so it’s about ‘gain’ and ‘lost’]</p>
<hr>
<h1 id="Circumscribe"><a href="#Circumscribe" class="headerlink" title="Circumscribe"></a>Circumscribe</h1><p>=restrict</p>
<p>the other topic of this chapter is <em>Laetitia</em> (deriving from the root word laeta, meaning “happy”, “glad”, “lucky”, “successful”, “prosperous”, “luxurious”, “lush”, or “abounding”)</p>
<p>The connection is control the pleasures by the amorous relation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To <strong>keep</strong> the pleasure …to place within a parenthesis of the unthinkable those broad depressive zones which separate such pleasures: “to forget” the loved being <strong>outside</strong> of the pleasures that being bestows.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I with the beloved one, we are inside and outside the amorous pleasure at the same time.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Gaudium</em> (Latin source of <em>joy</em>) is “the pleasure the <strong>soul</strong> experiences when it considers the possession of a present or future good as assured</p>
<p><em>Laetitia</em> is a <strong>lively</strong> pleasure, “a state in which pleasure predominates within us” (among other, often contradictory sensations)</p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="Coeur"><a href="#Coeur" class="headerlink" title="Coeur"></a>Coeur</h1><p>= heart</p>
<p>一言以蔽之</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The heart is the organ of desire.</p>
<p>You wait for me where I do not want to go: you love me where I do not exist. Or again: the world and I are not interested in the same thing; and to my misfortune, this divided thing is myself; I am not interested (Werther says) in my mind; you are not interested in my heart.</p>
<p>the heart is what remains to <em>me</em></p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="Comblement"><a href="#Comblement" class="headerlink" title="Comblement"></a>Comblement</h1><p>= fulfillment</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the desire and the possibility of complete satisfaction.</p>
<p>once I am no longer within the excessive, I feel frustrated; for me, enough means not enough</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What is the insights provided by <strong>transport</strong>. On uttering transport, whether the interface is crossed, or not quite, the irreversibilities have already long gone.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>language seems <em>pusillanimous</em>: I am transported, beyond language, mediocre, beyond the general: “There occurs an the counter which is <strong>intolerable</strong>, on account of the joy within it, and sometimes man is thereby reduced to nothing; this is what I call the transport. <u>The transport is the joy of which one cannot speak.</u>”</p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="Comprendre"><a href="#Comprendre" class="headerlink" title="Comprendre"></a>Comprendre</h1><p>= understand</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What do I think of love? —As a matter of fact, I think nothing at all of love. I’d be glad to know what it is, but being inside, <u>I see it in existence, not in essence</u>. What I want to know (love) is the very substance I employ in order to speak (the lover’s discourse).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>the very words for myself. I am curious about this matter but no necessity to be bothered on my own </p>
<blockquote>
<p>I want to “look in the face” <u>what is dividing me, cutting me off</u>. <strong>Understand your madness</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="Conduite"><a href="#Conduite" class="headerlink" title="Conduite"></a>Conduite</h1><p>= behavior [or rather, selection is discussed]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>From the lover’s point of view, the fact becomes consequential because it is immediately transformed into a sign: <u>it is the sign, not the fact, which is consequential</u></p>
<p>Everything signifies: by this proposition, I entrap myself, I bind myself in calculations, I keep myself from enjoyment.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Whatever signifies, is inevitable.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am not the man of mere “acting out”- my madness is tempered, it is not seen; it is <em>right away</em> that fear consequences, any consequence: it is my fear—my deliberation - which is “spontaneous.”</p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="Connivance"><a href="#Connivance" class="headerlink" title="Connivance"></a>Connivance</h1><p>= help in doing sth wrong; the failure to stop sth wrong from happening</p>
<p>[My neutral mirror, my enemies’ aspect, and me myself]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am jealous of the one I love and of the one who loves the one I love.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The medium and object are both entity associated with desire, direct and indirect.</p>
<h1 id="Contacts"><a href="#Contacts" class="headerlink" title="Contacts"></a>Contacts</h1><p>[the contact in this chapter refers to sexual desires]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Every contact, for the lover, raises the question of an answer: the skin is asked to reply.</p>
<p>a kind of festival not of the senses but of meaning.</p>
<p>In the lover’s realm, there is no acting out: no propulsion, perhaps even no pleasure—nothing but signs, a frenzied activity of language: to institute, on each furtive occasion, the system (the paradigm) of demand and response.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Desire is not about the real behavior nor pleasure, but the sign of demand and response.</p>
<h1 id="Contingencies"><a href="#Contingencies" class="headerlink" title="Contingencies"></a>Contingencies</h1><p>= accidents, incidents</p>
<h1 id="Corps"><a href="#Corps" class="headerlink" title="Corps"></a>Corps</h1><p>= body</p>
<p>[Observation of body parts is an amorous action, especially of those unnoticed parts, hair root, nails, eyelash. Idols, by their nature of work, expose themselves actively under the lens, providing the space for imagination. For any entity like me, tends to observe the others, than showcasing oneself]</p>
<h1 id="Declaration"><a href="#Declaration" class="headerlink" title="Declaration"></a>Declaration</h1><p>[The following paragraph is so…erotic. It is the very reason that I continue reading literature and linguistics.]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Language is a skin: I rub my language against the other. It is as if I had words instead of fingers, or fingers at the tip of my words. My language trembles with desire. The emotion derives from a double contact: on the one hand, a whole activity of discourse discreetly, indirectly focuses upon a single signified, which is “I desire you,” and releases, nourishes, ramifies it to the point of explosion (language experiences orgasm upon touching itself); on the other hand, I enwrap the other in my words, I caress, brush against, talk up this contact, I extend myself to make the commentary to which I submit the relation endure.</p>
<p>Retracing our steps from here, one might say that every discussion of love (however detached its tonality) inevitably involves a secret allocution (I am addressing Lacan<br>someone whom you do not know but who is there, at the end of my maxims).</p>
<p>No one wants to speak of love unless it is <strong>for</strong> someone.</p>

<h1 id="Dedication"><a href="#Dedication" class="headerlink" title="Dedication"></a>Dedication</h1><p>The amorous gift, a subject dedicates smth to the loved being </p>
<blockquote>
<p>To speak of the gift is to place it in an exchange <em>economy</em> (of sacrifice, competition, etc.); which stands opposed to silent expenditure.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[real economy is UNLOST]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(Love is mute, Novalis says; only<br>poetry makes it speak.) Song means nothing: it is in this that you will understand at last what it is that I give you; as useless as the wisp of yarn, the pebble held out to his mother by the child.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>the gift is delivered, sometimes, through uttering</p>
<p>About writing and the loved being:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>there is a certain adequation between these objects and your person. But writing does not possess this obligingness. <u>Writing is dry, obtuse</u>; a kind of steamroller, <u>writing advances, indifferent, indelicate</u>, and would kill “father, mother, lover” rather than deviate from its fatality </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The amorous being is a double edged sword</p>
<p>The gift given or received, can be a power, a cost, to kill, to kidnap, to suffocate, to let one be but oneself. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>there is no benevolence [kindness] within writing, rather a terror: it smothers the other, who, far from perceiving the<br>gift in it, reads there instead an assertion of mastery, of power, of pleasure, of solitude. Whence the cruel paradox of the dedication: I seek at all costs to give you what smothers you.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And Thus,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>amorous dedication is <u>impossible</u> (I shall not be satisfied with a worldly or mundane signature, pretending to dedicate to you a work which escapes us both).</p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="Depense"><a href="#Depense" class="headerlink" title="Depense"></a>Depense</h1><p>= Expenditure [associated with economy of amorous subject. I have to reclaim that it is more conceptual and financial]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Such exuberance can be interlaced with melancholy, with depressions and suicidal impulses, for the lover’s discourse is not an average of states; but such a disequilibrium belongs to that black economy which marks me with its aberration and, so to speak, with its intolerable <strong>luxury</strong>.</p>

<h1 id="Disreality"><a href="#Disreality" class="headerlink" title="Disreality"></a>Disreality</h1><p>Withdrawal of reality experience</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sometimes the world is unreal (I utter it differently), sometimes it is disreal (I utter it with only the greatest difficulty if at all).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[“Disreal” is different from “unreal”. “Unreality” is utterable, while “disreality” is nowhere. It is isolated self-assembly entity. On the last day in the gateway house, M said “you can even ask me to marry you”. At the instance the world does not carry any meaning. Just in vain. Those cat-and-dog roleplays do not belong to such kind - there can be an “unreal” picture in those cases. But not very. M can ask her to stay, but that really, means literally nothing. That is my understanding of “disreality”] </p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am not crazy. But sometimes, once my bad temper is exhausted, I have no language left at all: the world is not “unreal” (I could then utter it: there are arts of the unreal, among them the greatest arts of all), but disreal: reality has fled from it, is nowhere, so that I no longer have any meaning (any paradigm) available to me;</p>
<p>The unreal .) is uttered, abundantly (a thousand<br>novels, a thousand poems). But the disreal cannot be uttered; for if I utter it (if I lunge at it, even with a clumsy or overliterary sentence), I emerge from it. </p>

<p>I am both too big and too weak for writing: I am alongside it</p>
<p>language is both too much and too littlie, excessive and impoverished</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[So here is the very result:]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To know that one does not write for the other, to<br>know that these things <strong>I am going to write will never cause me to be loved by the one I love</strong> (the other), to know that writing compensates for nothing, sublimates nothing, that it is precisely <em>there where you are not</em> - this is the beginning of writing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[So when I looked back hundreds of pieces of dairy I wrote before for a particular person. I am writing not because I really want something from the person. The friendship is inspiring and delightful enough. A real relationship is overwhelming that I cannot handle. But rather there was  something excessive in my mind that overflow. The writings are for no one. Not even myself.]</p>
<h1 id="Errance"><a href="#Errance" class="headerlink" title="Errance"></a>Errance</h1><p>= errantry. [Errant, means going around, wandering. The explanation is given by author as below]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Though each love is experienced as unique and though the subject <strong>rejects</strong> the notion of repeating it elsewhere later on, he sometimes discovers in himself a kind of diffusion of amorous desire; he then realizes he is doomed to <strong>wander</strong> until he dies, from love to love.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[This indicates two things, one is inevitable repetitions. The other is permanent temporary]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How does a love ends? No one ever knows anything about it….I myself cannot (as an enamored subject) construct my love story to the end: I am its poet (its bard) only for the beginning; the end, like my own death, belongs to others; it is up to them to write the fiction, the external, mythic narrative.</p>
<p>it is never said of the Phoenix that it dies, but only that it is reborn (then I can be reborn without dying?).</p>
<p>Throughout life, all of love’s “failures” resemble<br>one another </p>
</blockquote>
<p>[And thus repetitions is granted ]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The “perpetual mutability” which animates me, far from<br>squeezing all those I encounter into the same functional type.</p>
<p>errantry does not align—it produces iridescence [colorfulness]: what results is the nuance. Thus I move on, to the end of the tapestry [weaved colored cloth], from one nuance to the next (the nuance is the last state of a color which can be named; <u>the nuance is the Intractable</u>).</p>

<h1 id="Exile"><a href="#Exile" class="headerlink" title="Exile"></a>Exile</h1><p>[The very topic I am looking into these days.]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Deciding to give up the amorous condition, the subject sadly discovers himself exiled from his Image-repertoire… which is “a kind of long insomnia.”</p>
<p>That is the price to be paid: the death of the Image for my own life.</p>
<p>As long as this strange mourning lasts, I will therefore have to undergo two contrary miseries: to suffer from the fact that the other is present (continuing, in spite of himself, to wound me) and to suffer from the fact that the other is dead (dead at least as I loved him). Thus I am wretched (an old habit) over a telephone call which does not come, but I must remind myself at the same time that <u>this silence</u>, in any case, <u>is insignificant</u>, since I have decided to get over any such concern: it was merely an aspect of the amorous image that it was to telephone me; once this image is gone, the telephone, whether it rings or not, resumes its trivial existence.</p>
<p>A double lack: I cannot even invest my misery, as I could when I suffered from being in love. In those days I desired, dreamed, struggled; the benefit lay before me, merely delayed, traversed<br>by contretemps [unfortunate events].</p>
<p>It was as if I were trying to embrace one last time, hysterically, someone about to die—someone for whom I was about to die: I was performing a denial of separation.</p>

<p>[Not only ordeal, good memory together will also become indifference. That is how time works, and how the world works]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the fade-out of voices is a good thing; the voices of the narrative come, go, disappear, overlap; we do not know who is speaking; the text speaks, that is all: no more image, nothing but language.</p>

<p>my love is “a sexual organ of unparalleled sensitivity which trembles as it makes me utter terrible cries, the cries of a huge but stinking ejaculation, at grips with the ecstatic gift that one makes of oneself as a naked, obscene victim … mocked by the loud laughter of the whores.”</p>
<p>“The distinctive mark of modern souls is not lying but <em>innocence</em>, incarnate in lying moralism. To discover this <em>innocence everywhere</em>—that may be the most disheartening part of our task.”</p>
<p><u>Whatever is anachronic is obscene</u>. As a (modern)<br>divinity, History is repressive, <strong>History forbids us to be out of time. Of the past we tolerate only the ruin</strong>, the monument, kitsch, what is <u>amusing</u>: we reduce this past to no more than its signature. The lover’s sentiment is old-fashioned, but this antiquation cannot even be recuperated as a spectacle: love falls outside of <u>interesting time</u>; no historical, polemical meaning can be given to it; it is in this that it is obscene.</p>
<p>The moral tax levied by society on all transgressions affects passion still more than sex today.</p>

<p>when I cry, I always address myself to someone, and because the recipient of my tears is not always the same: I adapt my ways of weeping to the kind of blackmail which, by my tears, I mean to exercise around me.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>[a scene rather than a particular person ravishes me.]</p>

<p>Designating you as thus, I enable you to escape the death of classification, I kidnap you from the Other, from language, I want you to be <strong>immortal</strong>. As he is, the loved being no longer receives any meaning, neither from myself nor from the system in which he is caught; he is no more than a text without context; I no longer need or desire to decipher him; he is in a sense the supplement of his own site. If he were only a site, I might well, someday, replace him, but I can substitute nothing for the supplement of his site, his thus.</p>
<p>I love the other, not according to his (accountable) qualities, but according to his existence; by a movement one might well call mystical, I love, not what he is, but that he is.</p>
<p>acceding to the other’s thus, I no longer oppose oblation to desire: it seems to me that I can make myself desire the other less and delight in him more.</p>
<p>The worst enemy of thus is gossip</p>

<p>Sexual pleasure is not metonymic: once taken, it is cut off: it was the Feast, always terminated and instituted only by a temporary, supervised lifting of the prohibition. Tenderness, on the contrary, is nothing but an infinite, insatiable metonymy; the gesture, the episode of tenderness (the delicious harmony of an evening) can only be interrupted with laceration: everything seems called into question once again: return of rhythm disappearance of nirvana.</p>
<p>But if I receive it (and this can be simultaneous) within the field of desire, I am disturbed: tenderness, by rights, is not exclusive … Where you are tender, you speak your plural.</p>

We have a lot of troubles but prefer to hide them deep down inside our heart until they accumulate into depression and threaten our mental health.</p><p>If I were in charge of wellness and health center, I would like to hold a workshop that encourage students to write down their troubles as a letter and send it to their family and friends.</p><p>I have some reasons as following:</p><p>Firstly, when we are writing down our confusions and troubles, we are automatically organizing them. We will make things clearer and finally may somehow solve those problems, which we are glad to see.</p><p>Secondly, it is proved that expressive writing, for example, writing down your emotion in a letter, helps reduce your pressure and anxiety. Dr. Pennebaker from the University of Texas pointed out in his research that when we are doing expressive writing, we are exploring our innermost feeling, and it will reduce the stigma-related stress. Once stress is released, then delight and happiness is on the way.</p><p>Last but not least, after sending out our letter, our imagination of the receiver’s reaction or the expectation of reply are also part of our pleasure.</p><p>To sum up, writing a letter about your trouble is the process of organizing, expressing and expecting, which I believe will make us happier</p>]]></content>

Put your answer in pen. </p><p>“Education isn’t for getting a job. It’s about developing yourself as a human being.” – Liz Berry, electronics engineer and poet. Discuss Liz Berry’s point of view, and explain to what extent you agree with it. </p></blockquote><p><u>The character of education is controversial nowadays. Engineer and poet Liz Berry argued that education should aim at self developing instead of education, and I agree with him to a large extent.</u></p><p>First, it’s undebatable that through education we obtain various knowledge, <strong>which certainly boosts self developing</strong>. The knowledge, which is based on the observation and reasoning of numerous wise scholars, will absolutely brings us a new point of view and deepen our understanding on the operation of the universe. <strong>In the process of exploring the world, we know more about ourselves, thus improving our own.</strong></p><p>Moreover, how we think, or so-called methodology, which is also emphasized in education, <strong>also enhances our consciousness of being</strong>. It is education that tells us our brain is supposed to work in a scientific way instead of struggling in mess and chaos. <strong>With rational and critical thinking, we are able to put forward more advanced ideas and bring out the best of ourselves.</strong></p><p><u>However, LIz Berry’s disapproval on the relation ship between education and jobs need reconsidering.</u> It is true that job-hunting skills are not everything about education, but the basic concepts of job market should be taught or trained. Seemingly ordinary might it be, there is nothing better than a job where we can use what we have learned and finally fulfil our values as a human being. <strong>In a word, education that fails to bring along a job is undoubtedly a failure. </strong></p><p><strong>From above, education helps us develop ourselves through contributing to our academic knowledge and cultivating the methodology. Jobs is not necessarily all about education, but should be part of it.</strong></p><p>(274 words)</p><h1 id="Revised-Practice-Writing-2"><a href="#Revised-Practice-Writing-2" class="headerlink" title="Revised Practice Writing 2"></a>Revised Practice Writing 2</h1><blockquote><p>INSTRUCTIONS Write about 250 ~ 300 words. Put your answer in pen. </p><p>“The downloading of music and films should be made free for all users.” Discuss with reasons and examples. </p></blockquote><p><u>The Internet contributes to convenient modern life, but also triggers arguments</u> Someone calls for free downloading of music and films, which, from my point of view, is totally a terrible idea.</p><p><u>Downloading a piece of work with copyright is neither legal nor morally correct</u>, and <strong>it should be forbidden by relevant restrictions</strong>. The works are protected by the copyright law, thus downloading or spread of pirate version absolutely is regarded as a crime. What’s more, the producers and composers live on selling their films or music. If everyone appreciate their work without paying, they will gain motivation from nowhere to continue producing high-quality films and music. <strong>Therefore, rational consumers ought to avoiding pirate sources online.</strong></p><p>In addition, online sharing is usually too free to care about age limitation, possibly leading to irreversible result. For example, violent or sexual contents are considered not appropriate to young children. However, free spread online makes it possible for children to get access to those works before they reach certain age, leaving a perpetuated negative impression. In order to protect our children from unfavorable scene in films, more related restrictions should be carried out to <strong>prohibit free downloading.</strong></p><p>Last but not least, illegal spread of films and music also leads to misunderstanding to them, <strong>which is damaging the work itself and absolutely not approved</strong>. It is often seen on the Internet that films are cut into segments arbitrarily and then shared. This kind of videos usually destroy the integrity of original work and make it difficult for the audience to comprehend the work and perceive the idea that the storytellers struggle for thousands of hours to deliver. <strong>If we do not intend to ruin their efforts, we should appeal for banning free downloading.</strong> **</p><p><strong>To conclude, downloading films and music online should be strictly restricted considering its violating copyright, and potential negative effects on teenagers.</strong> </p><p>(313 words)</p>]]></content>

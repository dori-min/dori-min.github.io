Snow Country is a place as quiet as the dead of night. Because of the cold outside, I grew into an adult who indulges in movies and stories when at home. I hope that the scenes here, drawn from my imagination, might float with you on your sea of words. Prologue: “The Auto Memories Doll” Some time has passed since this term was all the rage. The first one was created by Dr. Orlando, the world’s authority on automatons. It all began when his wife Molly, a novelist, complained of her clouding vision. Molly, having devoted most of her life to her words, was crestfallen as they faded away from her. Once reduced to blindness, it seemed as if her strength also was wasting away. Dr. Orlando could not bear to see his dear wife this way, and as such he devised the Auto Memories Doll. It was a contraptioncapable of recording a person’s spoken words: a “borrowed pen,” as it were. At the time, the doctor had meant it merely a creation for his dearest, but the model quickly spread, and soon such dolls were acting to support myriad other people. Today Auto Memories Dolls are widely known, even available for rental at a modest price. [C1P1]The Novelist and the Doll, Part 1 ⇖ Chapter 1: “The Novelist and the Doll” Roswell was a city of green, ensconced in the beauty of nature. It bared itself among the foothills of tall mountains. Among those of ample resource, Roswell was known as a summer retreat; a town of villas and cottages, homes away from home. In spring, the landscapes burst with flowers, bringing light to their admirers’ eyes. In summer, hikers there sought a moment of respite beside the city’s famed waterfall, well-loved for ages. In autumn, the rain of leaves softened the heart, and in winter the world itself was bestowed a mute tranquility. Each season’s flourish on stage was distinct; it was a land magnanimous upon the eyes of visitors at any time of year. Vacation homes throughout the town formed a swatch of variegated wooden rooftops, both big and small. Land there was not cheap. Simply owning a home in Roswell was a sufficient sign of affluence. In the city’s heart, countless shops courted one main throughway and catered to endless tourists. During holidays, this corridor was inevitably thronged with shoppers, and the people created a fabric of cacophony appropriate to city life, each weaving his happy bustle into the song of the street. The wares set out were nothing to scoff at–far from so, in fact, given the town’s remote location. Most residents of Roswell sought convenience and so built their villas in the city proper. Those who settled elsewhere were the town eccentrics. It was now autumn in Roswell. Cirrocumulus wafted in ripples high up in the sky. Far removed from the foothills was a small lake, an almost forgotten stop along the town’s busy tourist circuit. One small cottage stood quietly by its waters. Viewed with kindness, it was a vintage home bearing a distinguished facade. To less forgiving eyes, the house was a monument to disrepair, long abandoned by human hands. One first had to pass under its arched gates, white now only by virtue of their long companionship with the sun. From there, a short path led through a garden buried in weeds and nameless flowers. Finally, at the path’s end, the home itself came into view. The red brick walls were in such decay that one could only conclude the owner had no intent of ever patching them. Here and there a roof tile was split, once-orderly ranks now cruelly dismembered. Immediately next to the entrance, vines had coiled themselves in knots about a swing, ensuring that it would swing no more. It was both evidence of a child and evidence that the child was certainly here no longer. The owner of the house was a man in the prime of life. His name was Oscar. He was a screenwriter working without pretense of nom de plume. His hair was red with a curl, and his black-rimmed glasses could hardly contain the thick lenses with which they had been charged. Oscar’s back was slightly hunched, but his face was fresh, lending him an air of youthfulness belying his real age. Sensitive to the cold, he was never without a sweater. All in all, Oscar was an unremarkable man, hardly seeming fit to be the hero of any story. To Oscar, this house was not a villa. Quite simply, Roswell was home, and it was in this house that Oscar lived. It was built to house not him alone, but also his wife and young daughter. The rooms had been quite spacious for three, but now they were used by only one. Oscar lived alone. Both his wife and child had already departed for the other world. The wife had succumbed to an illness with a name so meandering it was hard to even remember. To put it simply, her blood had coagulated in her veins, blocking them. Death quickly followed. The condition was genetic. Her father, too, had suffered that fate. Oscar had known his wife was an orphan. He’d heard her plaintive story of the many from her family who had died young. But it was not until after she died that he grasped the true reason for this. At the funeral, her close friend had confided in Oscar. “She was frightened. She thought if it were known, no one would ever want to marry her. So she kept it hidden.” When the words hit Oscar’s ears, only one thought echoed through his mind: “Why?” “Why? Why? Why?” All you had to do was say it. You could have shared anything with me. There’s so much we could have done. We could have searched together for a cure. We had all this useless excess of money to throw at it. It was clear that Oscar’s wife had not married him for his money. They’d met before his break as a screenwriter. She was a librarian at the library he frequented. And in any case, it was Oscar himself who first began to stare. How pretty, he’d thought. And she’s the one in charge of the new arrivals corner. It always has such good books. As he fell in love with her books, so too did he fall in love with her. “Why?” The question echoed some hundred million times. It buaround his mind, then finally vanished. His wife’s friend was an accomplished woman. While Oscar’s heart floundered in the wake of loss, she worked vigorously to attend to the young daughter who had been left in Oscar’s care. Left to himself, the man would go all day without eating, so she brought warm food to their home. The girl, in turn, sobbed for her missing mother, so with her she sat, gently tying the girl’s hair in braids as her mother used to do. Perhaps, for a brief moment, there had been a spark of love between Oscar and this woman. Late one night, when Oscar’s daughter had been sick in bed with a fever and had suddenly begun to vomit uncontrollably, it was she who rushed the girl to the hospital. And it was she, not Oscar, who first learned that the girl was afflicted with the same ailment. From there, the disease progressed gradually. But for Oscar, it was all much too fast. [C1P2]Desperate to avoid a repeat of their recent tragedy, Oscar turned to the finest physicians from across the land. They moved from one great hospital to the next. Oscar implored each doctor they met, and through his appeals learned of a new, experimental treatment. The decision seemed an easy one. Yet every herb has its demons. The girl clamored with each swallow, a sight which ate away at her doting father as the days of treatment stretched on. The new treatment seemed to have no effect on her symptoms. Having no further recourse, the doctors declared it a lost cause and withdrew from the fight. Oscar became plagued with the absurd notion that his lonely wife was beckoning to their daughter from the world beyond. He wailed at her grave, “Don’t take her from me!” But the dead speak no words. Oscar was teetering on the edge. Perhaps unexpectedly, it was his wife’s friend who broke first. Exhausted by endless fretting as the girl hung in limbo, she appeared less and less often at the hospital, then finally stopped coming altogether. Oscar and his daughter were now truly alone. The girl’s extensive medication had left her emaciated. Her once-milky skin was a sickly yellow and her once-rosy cheeks pallid. Her honeyed hair, too, was now falling out. Oscar could no longer bear to look at her. After endlessly pushing fruitless questions upon the doctors, he finally relented. The girl would continue on analgesics alone. All other treatment would stop. Oscar resolved that if nothing else, his daughter’s short life would not end in suffering. The next while was peaceful. They spent happy days together. He saw his daughter smile for the first time in months. So continued their last few days of light. It was glorious autumn outside on the day that she died. Color was slipping from the world drip by drip, but the sky was bright blue and cloudless. From the window, one caught candid glimpses of trees dressed in reds and yellows. A fountain stood in the hospital grounds, offering respite to the weary. Fallen leaves floated soundlessly across its pool. Each leaf there had fallen to the water’s surface and drifted there until finally pulled into a clump of comrades. Now they floated aimlessly together. New leaves were always pulled in, almost as if by magnet. Thus, even in their wreckage, lives lost to the season, they emerged in beautiful synchronization. On seeing them, the girl spoke. “How pretty. “The way the water’s blue and the color of the leaves mix together. It’s so pretty. Father, if a person stepped on those leaves, do you think they’d walk across the pond without falling in?” Ah, the innocence of a child. Surely gravity and weight would conspire to bring one’s body plunging in, but Oscar could deny his daughter no more. “And if you held an umbrella, my sweet, you could use the wind and perhaps even float just above it.” His tone was playful. He longed so badly to dote on his helpless daughter just a little more. And as she listened to his words, her eyes sparkled. “Yes. Yes, that’s just what I’ll do. I’ll dance across the water for you.” Someday I’ll dance for you. On the lake, by our home now far away. When the leaves drift across the water in autumn. Shortly after, she fell into a coughing fit. One cough, two, then several more. And then, as if stolen away, she was gone. She had been but nine years old. When Oscar brought his arms under the husk she had left behind, it felt dreadfully light. Too light, even for a body now short a soul. Had she ever even been alive? Had it just been one long dream? Tears came to his eyes. The girl was buried alongside her mother. Oscar returned to the house built for three, and there he began his life of silence. Oscar had financial means enough to live on without working. A royalty system brought in money each time his widely-used scripts were employed. He would never scrape the bottom of his savings, and he would never go hungry. After several years of mourning for his wife and daughter, a long-lost work acquaintance reached out to Oscar. Wouldn’t he try his hand at one more script? It was at the behest of an elite performing troupe, one which any actor would clamor to be a part of. For Oscar, whose past work was known but who had all but vanished from the industry, it was an honor simply to be asked. He’d spent so many days languishing in sloth, wallowing in sadness, indulging in self-pity. Man is a thing that tires. Whether happiness or sadness, he cannot bear to live always with that alone. That is how he is built. Oscar agreed to the job in his second reply, determined to lift his pen once more. But here the trouble began. In desperation to escape his harsh reality, Oscar had turned to–no, embraced–the bottle. And with it came a smattering of drugs to ensure happy thoughts at least in dreams. With the help of his doctor he had somehow managed to conquer the drink and drugs themselves, yet in their wake, his hands were left forever trembling. Whether words laid on paper or struck with keys, his efforts to push forward seemed hopeless. His breast was full with words; he merely needed to find the way to bring them forth. He turned once more to his acquaintance to ask for advice. “I’ve just the thing. “We need to get you an Auto Memories Doll.” “What’s that?” “Ah, my friend, you’ve been away from the world too long… I’m worried about you. Auto Memories Dolls. Everybody knows about them. You can even rent them out. Hardly costs a thing anymore. Yes, that’s what we’ll do. I’ll have one sent over for you to try out.” “I’m going to get help from a… doll?” “Hah! A special kind of doll, to be sure.” And that was how Oscar came to use a new kind of tool, one whose name he’d only just learned. Oscar and the “Auto Memories Doll.” This was the beginning of their fates entwined. [C1P3]A woman made her way up the mountain path. Her bangs hung freely. Braids laced the crown of her head, held together with a ribbon of deep, velvety red. Her slender frame was wrapped in a snowy white summer dress tied at the waist. The dress’ silk, pleated skirt fluttered angelically with each step she took. The emerald brooch affixed at her bosom&lt;/u&gt; sparkled. Over the dress, she wore a sleek, Prussian blue jacket. Her long boots had deepened into a cocoa brown with age. And on this day, as she passed under the white arch of Oscar’s home, she held in her hand a heavy-looking trunk. Just as the woman stepped into the front garden, a gust of autumn wind bellowed, bringing red, yellow, and brown leaves swirling about her in dancing rings. Her vision seemed to falter, as if these swirling remnants of autumn had pulled a curtain down before her. She reached a hand to the brooch affixed at her breast, squeezed it tight, and intoned in a low voice some words that were eclipsed by those wings of autumn as they continued to flutter excitedly. Having reached no ears, the spoken words melted away into space. When the mischievous wind died down, the woman seemed to set aside her recent display of uncertainty. She continued on to the entryway with purpose. There she pressed on the buzzer with one finger of a hand encased in black glove. The house’s bell reverberated like a screech escaped from hell. A moment later, the door opened. The house’s red-haired owner peered out from the gap. It was hard to tell whether he’d just woken up or whether he’d not slept at all. In either case, he was clearly in no state to be receiving guests. His clothing and face were both disheveled. On seeing the woman, Oscar let slip a slight look of surprise. He seemed to have been taken aback by the woman’s most peculiar appearance. Or perhaps he had been caught off guard by her singular beauty. Whatever the case, he found himself, for a moment, short of breath. “You’re… the ‘Auto Memories Doll’?” “That is correct. Please inform me of any assistance you might require, and I will be happy to oblige. Auto Memories Doll Violet Evergarden, at your service.” The storybook blonde-haired, blue-eyed beauty spoke these words with no trace of obsequiousness. Rather, they emanated from her lips with the deep clarity of a well-polished gemstone. The woman who had identified herself as Violet Evergarden carried herself in quiet beauty, the very essence of a doll. Her blue eyes, laced by eyelashes of golden thread, sparkled with the mysteries of the seabed. From the milk-white skin of her cheek blushed the splendor of cherry petals at their peak. Her rouge-tinted lips glistened invitingly. Nothing about her was lacking. Her beauty was as full as the moon at its peak. Had she not blinked, one would have thought she was a static work of art. Oscar knew nothing about Auto Memories Dolls. The arrangements for Violet’s arrival had been handled entirely by the same friend who had convinced Oscar to take on this new writing job. “It’ll be delivered in a few days,” he’d said. And here she was at last. From the way his friend spoke, Oscar had assumed some small package would arrive at his door, care of the postman. He’d open up the box and inside would be a small, mechanical doll. He was hardly prepared for this thing so lifelike, this… automaton. How far has civilization progressed while I’ve holed myself up here? Oscar had never shown particular interest in any of the ways of the world. He read no newspapers or magazines, and he rarely socialized. If it weren’t for the friends who showed concern for him, perhaps his only interaction would have been with the deliveryman from the grocer’s. Already Oscar was regretting his hasty decision. Clearly he should have spent more time looking into the matter of the doll before giving his consent. The mere thought of having another person in the house meant only for that long-lost family of three did not sit well with him. It was like an unpleasant aftertaste. Another person… or something that resembled one, anyway. Oscar felt as if he were somehow betraying his family. Violet, perfectly unaware of any of these thoughts swirling about Oscar’s head, followed him into the living room and set herself down on the sofa when invited. When Oscar offered her tea, she drank it. These modern automatons seemed to be quite advanced. “What happens to the tea after you drink it?” Sensing Oscar’s tone of disbelief, Violet gently tipped her head to one side as she answered. “Ultimately it is discharged from my body, after which I believe it returns to the Earth.” An answer befitting of a machine. “To tell the truth… I’m at a bit of a loss right now. You’re a bit… different from what I expected.” Violet glanced down as if to confirm her own appearance, then abruptly stood up from the sofa and returned Oscar’s stare. “Is there something about me which does not meet your expectations?” “Uh… well, it’s not exactly my expectations…” “If the additional wait would not inconvenience you, I can arrange for the dispatch of a different doll, one more suitable to your needs.” “Ah, no… that’s not what I’m trying to say. Uh, well… let’s just try this out, I suppose. If you can do the work, that’s all that matters. You seem unobtrusive enough.” “If it pleases you, I will restrict my respiration to the minimally required level.” “Ah, no, that won’t be necessary.” [C1P4]“I have been dispatched here to fulfill your need for a scribe. I will perform my duties to your utmost satisfaction so as to not sully the Auto Memories Doll name. It matters not whether my tools are pen and paper or typewriter. Please make use of me as planned.” Violet uttered these words with her large, jewel-like eyes affixed firmly on Oscar’s. It made Oscar feel a bit fidgety, but he managed to answer with an awkward nod. The doll had been requested for a period of two weeks. They had only that much time to complete one full script. Oscar composed himself and led Violet into his study, intending to begin work immediately. However, on arrival there, it became clear that Violet’s first duties would not be as a scribe but as a housekeeper. Oscar had pulled everything necessary into one room for it to double as both an office and a bedroom. Strewn about the floor were dirtied clothes and dishes filled with half-eaten meals. It was a miserable spectacle. Such was the mess that one could hardly find space to walk across the floor. Violet remained silent as she again trained her blue eyes upon Oscar. The eyes themselves seemed to accuse. Did you do anything at all to prepare for my arrival? “…I’m sorry.” Oscar himself knew that it was not a room befitting a working man. Since beginning his days alone, Oscar had hardly touched the living room. As a result, that room had remained in quite a presentable state. But the well-trodden rooms of his house–this office, the washroom, and the bathroom–had all fallen into a most wretched state. He suddenly felt quite grateful that Violet was an automaton. Her physical appearance suggested a young woman at the twilight of her teens, or perhaps in her early twenties. Oscar could think of any number of other torturous things he would prefer to endure than the situation of having to show a real girl of that age this embarrassment of an office. It was unchivalrous, and Oscar’s advancing years were no excuse. “Sir, I must respectfully remind you that I am here to act as a scribe, not as a maid.” Yet even as she spoke, Violet pulled from her trunk a white, frilled apron and began cleaning the room with a certain zeal. Thus passed their first day. On the second, they finally managed to both seat themselves in the office and set about the real work ahead. To be more precise, Oscar reclined on the bed, and Violet sat in the office’s lone chair. She rested her hands on the typewriter stationed at the desk. “She spoke–” As Oscar began to dictate his story, Violet’s hands moved over the keys with a flurry of speed. Her strokes were yet quiet, and of course performed perfectly from memory. Oscar’s eyes grew wide with surprise. “You’re quite… fast, aren’t you?” On receiving the compliment, Violet rolled up her sleeve and removed the black glove from one hand. She held the exposed arm up for Oscar to see. It ticked and whirred. A completely mechanical arm. The fingers and knuckles were of especially sturdy construction, finished with only a rudimentary coat of paint. “My parts have been chosen for maximum utility while still simulating human form. These were produced by Estark. They are renowned for their durability. They also boast a range of movement and compressive strength far exceeding that of human hands. They will suffice in allowing me to record your words precisely as you dictate.” “Is that so… Uh, well, you don’t need to write down what I’m saying now. Just the words in the script.” Oscar resumed his dictation. They took several breaks, but for the first day of writing, it seemed to go quite well. Of course, he’d already had the play structured out somewhere in his mind. So far it had seemed quite easy to find the words. And as he spoke, Oscar realized that Violet was a superb conduit and scribe. From the beginning, he’d noted her quiet appearance, and as they began to work she was every bit faithful to this impression. Though he hadn’t gone so far to ask it of her, he found that he really could not hear the sound of her breathing. The only sound at all in the room, besides Oscar’s own voice, was the click, clack of the typewriter. If he closed his eyes, it almost seemed as if he were pushing the keys himself. When he asked her to read back passages to check his progress, her voice was clear and perfectly inflected. Just listening to it was a joy. Through her voice, every passage seemed a majestic tale. So this is what has made them so popular. He finally seemed to gain a deep appreciation for the qualities of the Auto Memories Doll. But Oscar and Violet’s smooth progress halted abruptly on the fourth day. Several days passed without so much as a word written. Oscar was plagued with the writer’s most common affliction. Though the story seemed clear to him, the words would not spin together into the fabric they were meant to be. Long years of experience had taught Oscar what he must do in this situation. The answer was simple: stop writing. He was of the firm belief that no great writing was born when forced. He regretted having to make Violet wait. Violet, for her part, quickly and seriously complied with requests for any other type of work around the house, from cleaning to cooking. She seemed to have been designed with, first and foremost, a hardworking disposition. It had been quite some time since Oscar had eaten a home-cooked meal, still wafting up steam on service. He’d had many a meal delivered and occasionally even went out to eat, but such foods somehow paled in comparison with a simple meal prepared through the labors of a well-meaning novice. He ate unusual omelets whose every bite melted in his mouth. He ate a patty of hamburger mixed with tofu, presented on serving as “an exotic recipe carried from lands far to the East.” He ate fine pilafs of rice mixed with tangy sauces and flourishes of colorful vegetables. He ate seafood au gratin, a rare gem in this mountainous land. Violet inevitably balanced the meal with some sort of salad or soup on the side. Oscar was quite awed by it all.]]></content>

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[We UST students are famous for our stress and tension as it seems that most of us are not satisfied with our daily life. We have a lot of troubles but prefer to hide them deep down inside our heart until they accumulate into depression and threaten our mental health. If I were in charge of wellness and health center, I would like to hold a workshop that encourage students to write down their troubles as a letter and send it to their family and friends. I have some reasons as following: Firstly, when we are writing down our confusions and troubles, we are automatically organizing them. We will make things clearer and finally may somehow solve those problems, which we are glad to see. Secondly, it is proved that expressive writing, for example, writing down your emotion in a letter, helps reduce your pressure and anxiety. Dr. Pennebaker from the University of Texas pointed out in his research that when we are doing expressive writing, we are exploring our innermost feeling, and it will reduce the stigma-related stress. Once stress is released, then delight and happiness is on the way. Last but not least, after sending out our letter, our imagination of the receiver’s reaction or the expectation of reply are also part of our pleasure. To sum up, writing a letter about your trouble is the process of organizing, expressing and expecting, which I believe will make us happier]]></content>

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Today I went to ilang language advisor for suggestions on elpa writing. The suggestions I got and revised passages are as follows. Suggestions from advisorsSuggested structure Intro with thesis statement with my view/stand reason 1 reason 2 counter argument conclusion Revised practice writing 1&gt; INSTRUCTIONS Write about 250 ~ 300 words. Put your answer in pen. “Education isn’t for getting a job. It’s about developing yourself as a human being.” – Liz Berry, electronics engineer and poet. Discuss Liz Berry’s point of view, and explain to what extent you agree with it. The character of education is controversial nowadays. Engineer and poet Liz Berry argued that education should aim at self developing instead of education, and I agree with him to a large extent. First, it’s undebatable that through education we obtain various knowledge, which certainly boosts self developing. The knowledge, which is based on the observation and reasoning of numerous wise scholars, will absolutely brings us a new point of view and deepen our understanding on the operation of the universe. In the process of exploring the world, we know more about ourselves, thus improving our own. Moreover, how we think, or so-called methodology, which is also emphasized in education, also enhances our consciousness of being. It is education that tells us our brain is supposed to work in a scientific way instead of struggling in mess and chaos. With rational and critical thinking, we are able to put forward more advanced ideas and bring out the best of ourselves. However, LIz Berry’s disapproval on the relation ship between education and jobs need reconsidering. It is true that job-hunting skills are not everything about education, but the basic concepts of job market should be taught or trained. Seemingly ordinary might it be, there is nothing better than a job where we can use what we have learned and finally fulfil our values as a human being. In a word, education that fails to bring along a job is undoubtedly a failure. From above, education helps us develop ourselves through contributing to our academic knowledge and cultivating the methodology. Jobs is not necessarily all about education, but should be part of it. (274 words) Revised Practice Writing 2 INSTRUCTIONS Write about 250 ~ 300 words. Put your answer in pen. “The downloading of music and films should be made free for all users.” Discuss with reasons and examples. The Internet contributes to convenient modern life, but also triggers arguments Someone calls for free downloading of music and films, which, from my point of view, is totally a terrible idea. Downloading a piece of work with copyright is neither legal nor morally correct, and it should be forbidden by relevant restrictions. The works are protected by the copyright law, thus downloading or spread of pirate version absolutely is regarded as a crime. What’s more, the producers and composers live on selling their films or music. If everyone appreciate their work without paying, they will gain motivation from nowhere to continue producing high-quality films and music. Therefore, rational consumers ought to avoiding pirate sources online. In addition, online sharing is usually too free to care about age limitation, possibly leading to irreversible result. For example, violent or sexual contents are considered not appropriate to young children. However, free spread online makes it possible for children to get access to those works before they reach certain age, leaving a perpetuated negative impression. In order to protect our children from unfavorable scene in films, more related restrictions should be carried out to prohibit free downloading. Last but not least, illegal spread of films and music also leads to misunderstanding to them, which is damaging the work itself and absolutely not approved. It is often seen on the Internet that films are cut into segments arbitrarily and then shared. This kind of videos usually destroy the integrity of original work and make it difficult for the audience to comprehend the work and perceive the idea that the storytellers struggle for thousands of hours to deliver. If we do not intend to ruin their efforts, we should appeal for banning free downloading. ** To conclude, downloading films and music online should be strictly restricted considering its violating copyright, and potential negative effects on teenagers.

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Liz and blue bird Which one of the two girls is actually Liz and which one is blue bird? It also happens in real life. Sometimes we think of ourselves to limit others. However, it is we ourselves that build up the wall in our soul. The relationship between girls is hard to figure out its insight. There is too much hidden inside the easily-broken heart, albeit everything shows on the unintentional reaction and emotion. Violet Evergarden First attracted by its name. I was not good at memorizing the name of characters, esp. when it’s of katakana(foreigner’s name). But since the personality in this animation is clear, and the main story goes smoothly, I had no trouble dealing with them. Heroine Violet live from the love from Shousa. Shousa saved her life, gave her the beautiful name, Violet, treated her as a real person instead of a war machine, and most tragically, sacrificed his own life in the hope of a better life for her. I actually cried in the plot of Ann’s mother send a letter to Ann on her birthday every year. Some comments say that Violet looks like Saber with mechanic arm. To a certain degree I agree to this idea, but we should know that they have thoroughly different background and personality.]]></content>

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[前言&amp;吐槽写这一篇的计划从昨晚拖到早上，早上舍友到现在还没有起来，所以打算用手机看一下安排今天做什么。之前为了方便一直用的ios自带提醒事项+microsoft to-do来安排，microsoft to-do的ui我很喜欢，ios自带也能接受。但是这个同步真的很是问题，所以早上起来折腾了以下奇妙清单。不过整理的时候发现同步挺快，可能是我设置的问题，所以就容忍它最后一次 iGEM昨天在看了dance巡演ust部分之后去了iGEM的Information session。iGEM对于我来说是不陌生的，我的若干个朋友都有参与其中（数量之多让我惊奇）。所以比起其他人我更能直接了解到其中的运作和workload。 不过话说回来，在咨询几位大佬之后，就算后续有退出倾向我觉得也是可以原谅自己的。 Major首先，关于未来的发展方向，这是这一周考虑的很多的事情。 最初的梦想是化学与食品。但是发现自己比起格物致知更喜欢学以致用。 食品的梦想是要追的，雀巢不是说说。 不过昨天在知乎上看到一个说法：比起销售人员，产品研发人员更容易被取代。 这个和我个人一直以来的认知是不一样的。我个人认为，销售是谁都可以去做大，但是研发是要有专业知识和操作水平的人才能胜任的。而且研发掌握着技术，销售并不是。某种程度上是这样的，研发转销售容易，但是销售转研发难。 但是我忽略的侧面是，国情看来，现在的研发人员供过于求，而且主要是技术研发而非创新研发，也就是说说一个大学毕业生都可以完成的工作，并没有必要高薪请所谓“专家”。 所以，像现在一些大手食品企业的管理者也是身兼开发背景也不足为奇，只有两手并抓才能坐到最好。 那么从这个角度看，我原来的专注而单纯的想法是不足而取的。 另外一个，是关于化学与生物工程部门的化工和生工。 时至今日我还是没有能够特别区分我们学校的这两个专业的办法。但是感觉上从各种角度来说，现在对bioengineering感觉更看好一点，我觉得这个还是要摒弃之前的想法，值得自己好好考虑的。 毕竟bioengineering也有data analysis的部分，也能满足我对CS的兴趣。 结论参加iGEM，但是对于自己commitment要把握有数。 CBE你好，可以让我看得更清楚吗。 积极安排自己的schedule，希望能够在保证化学功底的基础上，适当接触CS知识。 了解，但不偏相信。 后记第一次整理自己的想法，感觉大多数主要内容还是在脑内还有微信交流完成的，并没有好好地记录自己的心路历程。但是得出了适当的结果，也不失为一次尝试。 补充其实昨天还有想到一些想法，一个是关于自己以后的wota活安排另外一个就是自己的语言学习安排。 以后会从事不一样的工作，但是掌握语言是终身受益的东西，希望自己能够成为像长辈一样优秀的多语言者。 资格证书的考试是适当的激励自己的办法。]]></content>

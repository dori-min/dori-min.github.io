    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Today I went to ilang language advisor for suggestions on elpa writing. The suggestions I got and revised passages are as follows. Suggestions from advisorsSuggested structure Intro with thesis statement with my view/stand reason 1 reason 2 counter argument conclusion Revised practice writing 1&gt; INSTRUCTIONS Write about 250 ~ 300 words. Put your answer in pen. “Education isn’t for getting a job. It’s about developing yourself as a human being.” – Liz Berry, electronics engineer and poet. Discuss Liz Berry’s point of view, and explain to what extent you agree with it. The character of education is controversial nowadays. Engineer and poet Liz Berry argued that education should aim at self developing instead of education, and I agree with him to a large extent. First, it’s undebatable that through education we obtain various knowledge, which certainly boosts self developing. The knowledge, which is based on the observation and reasoning of numerous wise scholars, will absolutely brings us a new point of view and deepen our understanding on the operation of the universe. In the process of exploring the world, we know more about ourselves, thus improving our own. Moreover, how we think, or so-called methodology, which is also emphasized in education, also enhances our consciousness of being. It is education that tells us our brain is supposed to work in a scientific way instead of struggling in mess and chaos. With rational and critical thinking, we are able to put forward more advanced ideas and bring out the best of ourselves. However, LIz Berry’s disapproval on the relation ship between education and jobs need reconsidering. It is true that job-hunting skills are not everything about education, but the basic concepts of job market should be taught or trained. Seemingly ordinary might it be, there is nothing better than a job where we can use what we have learned and finally fulfil our values as a human being. In a word, education that fails to bring along a job is undoubtedly a failure. From above, education helps us develop ourselves through contributing to our academic knowledge and cultivating the methodology. Jobs is not necessarily all about education, but should be part of it. (274 words) Revised Practice Writing 2 INSTRUCTIONS Write about 250 ~ 300 words. Put your answer in pen. “The downloading of music and films should be made free for all users.” Discuss with reasons and examples. The Internet contributes to convenient modern life, but also triggers arguments Someone calls for free downloading of music and films, which, from my point of view, is totally a terrible idea. Downloading a piece of work with copyright is neither legal nor morally correct, and it should be forbidden by relevant restrictions. The works are protected by the copyright law, thus downloading or spread of pirate version absolutely is regarded as a crime. What’s more, the producers and composers live on selling their films or music. If everyone appreciate their work without paying, they will gain motivation from nowhere to continue producing high-quality films and music. Therefore, rational consumers ought to avoiding pirate sources online. In addition, online sharing is usually too free to care about age limitation, possibly leading to irreversible result. For example, violent or sexual contents are considered not appropriate to young children. However, free spread online makes it possible for children to get access to those works before they reach certain age, leaving a perpetuated negative impression. In order to protect our children from unfavorable scene in films, more related restrictions should be carried out to prohibit free downloading. Last but not least, illegal spread of films and music also leads to misunderstanding to them, which is damaging the work itself and absolutely not approved. It is often seen on the Internet that films are cut into segments arbitrarily and then shared. This kind of videos usually destroy the integrity of original work and make it difficult for the audience to comprehend the work and perceive the idea that the storytellers struggle for thousands of hours to deliver. If we do not intend to ruin their efforts, we should appeal for banning free downloading. ** To conclude, downloading films and music online should be strictly restricted considering its violating copyright, and potential negative effects on teenagers.

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Liz and blue bird Which one of the two girls is actually Liz and which one is blue bird? It also happens in real life. Sometimes we think of ourselves to limit others. However, it is we ourselves that build up the wall in our soul. The relationship between girls is hard to figure out its insight. There is too much hidden inside the easily-broken heart, albeit everything shows on the unintentional reaction and emotion. Violet Evergarden First attracted by its name. I was not good at memorizing the name of characters, esp. when it’s of katakana(foreigner’s name). But since the personality in this animation is clear, and the main story goes smoothly, I had no trouble dealing with them. Heroine Violet live from the love from Shousa. Shousa saved her life, gave her the beautiful name, Violet, treated her as a real person instead of a war machine, and most tragically, sacrificed his own life in the hope of a better life for her. I actually cried in the plot of Ann’s mother send a letter to Ann on her birthday every year. Some comments say that Violet looks like Saber with mechanic arm. To a certain degree I agree to this idea, but we should know that they have thoroughly different background and personality.]]></content>

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[前言&amp;吐槽写这一篇的计划从昨晚拖到早上，早上舍友到现在还没有起来，所以打算用手机看一下安排今天做什么。之前为了方便一直用的ios自带提醒事项+microsoft to-do来安排，microsoft to-do的ui我很喜欢，ios自带也能接受。但是这个同步真的很是问题，所以早上起来折腾了以下奇妙清单。不过整理的时候发现同步挺快，可能是我设置的问题，所以就容忍它最后一次 iGEM昨天在看了dance巡演ust部分之后去了iGEM的Information session。iGEM对于我来说是不陌生的，我的若干个朋友都有参与其中（数量之多让我惊奇）。所以比起其他人我更能直接了解到其中的运作和workload。 不过话说回来，在咨询几位大佬之后，就算后续有退出倾向我觉得也是可以原谅自己的。 Major首先，关于未来的发展方向，这是这一周考虑的很多的事情。 最初的梦想是化学与食品。但是发现自己比起格物致知更喜欢学以致用。 食品的梦想是要追的，雀巢不是说说。 不过昨天在知乎上看到一个说法：比起销售人员，产品研发人员更容易被取代。 这个和我个人一直以来的认知是不一样的。我个人认为，销售是谁都可以去做大，但是研发是要有专业知识和操作水平的人才能胜任的。而且研发掌握着技术，销售并不是。某种程度上是这样的，研发转销售容易，但是销售转研发难。 但是我忽略的侧面是，国情看来，现在的研发人员供过于求，而且主要是技术研发而非创新研发，也就是说说一个大学毕业生都可以完成的工作，并没有必要高薪请所谓“专家”。 所以，像现在一些大手食品企业的管理者也是身兼开发背景也不足为奇，只有两手并抓才能坐到最好。 那么从这个角度看，我原来的专注而单纯的想法是不足而取的。 另外一个，是关于化学与生物工程部门的化工和生工。 时至今日我还是没有能够特别区分我们学校的这两个专业的办法。但是感觉上从各种角度来说，现在对bioengineering感觉更看好一点，我觉得这个还是要摒弃之前的想法，值得自己好好考虑的。 毕竟bioengineering也有data analysis的部分，也能满足我对CS的兴趣。 结论参加iGEM，但是对于自己commitment要把握有数。 CBE你好，可以让我看得更清楚吗。 积极安排自己的schedule，希望能够在保证化学功底的基础上，适当接触CS知识。 了解，但不偏相信。 后记第一次整理自己的想法，感觉大多数主要内容还是在脑内还有微信交流完成的，并没有好好地记录自己的心路历程。但是得出了适当的结果，也不失为一次尝试。 补充其实昨天还有想到一些想法，一个是关于自己以后的wota活安排另外一个就是自己的语言学习安排。 以后会从事不一样的工作，但是掌握语言是终身受益的东西，希望自己能够成为像长辈一样优秀的多语言者。 资格证书的考试是适当的激励自己的办法。]]></content>

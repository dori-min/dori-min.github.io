Then get some inspiration from a forum: inordinately (over)contemplated (contemplative), pensive, introspective, Possible translation for the third word「無理」: unreasonable; unjust; impossible; unnatural; excessive; overwork Here personally prefer ‘excessive’ Seems like I made up some new words lol translating is so hard.]]></content>

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Liz and blue bird Which one of the two girls is actually Liz and which one is blue bird? It also happens in real life. Sometimes we think of ourselves to limit others. However, it is we ourselves that build up the wall in our soul. The relationship between girls is hard to figure out its insight. There is too much hidden inside the easily-broken heart, albeit everything shows on the unintentional reaction and emotion. Violet Evergarden First attracted by its name. I was not good at memorizing the name of characters, esp. when it’s of katakana(foreigner’s name). But since the personality in this animation is clear, and the main story goes smoothly, I had no trouble dealing with them. Heroine Violet live from the love from Shousa. Shousa saved her life, gave her the beautiful name, Violet, treated her as a real person instead of a war machine, and most tragically, sacrificed his own life in the hope of a better life for her. I actually cried in the plot of Ann’s mother send a letter to Ann on her birthday every year. Some comments say that Violet looks like Saber with mechanic arm. To a certain degree I agree to this idea, but we should know that they have thoroughly different background and personality.]]></content>

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[今天考完了MATH1013。 总体自我感觉还是可以的，能想到的都做了出来，最后关头检查出来了错误。 结论就是自己已经形成了这种先快后慢的写题节奏，所以就按照自己的节奏去走就好了。 其中一道题目一下子想不出来做法，最后是用CENG1000里学到的一个计算方法算出来的。 果然理工科之间都有互通的地方。 继续努力啦。 今天开衣在名蛋全握，看推上的妹子repo，感觉可爱的妹子能很快被记住然后对应也很好真的好羡慕。 这个启发我是要学会好好化妆了。 不过自己也一定要变成那个样子吗？其实不一定，其实还有更适合自己的样子。就按照自己的路走就好了。 毕竟外国人+女生+年下这个都够成员记得了。 下次吹下我的（垃圾）考试成绩也许会让他们印象深刻吧。 想让推记得自己一点，果然还是喜欢她这件事的证明。 不过还是一直在玩大乱斗。 现在还在用大乱斗听着音乐。 ns大乱斗比wii感觉玩起来舒服很多。wii是横板过关（横版过关就只能看血量），就要一直往右边赶，而且卡关就gg了（想起当初有一关一直过不去，打了好多次，后来不知道怎么过去的。 呈现的不同音乐也让人审美不容易疲劳。像我玩其它游戏一两个小时就会累，但是大乱斗我这两天都估计七八个小时了吧。 冒险的大地图是在2d画面上呈现3d人物十分新颖。 整个UI都挺棒]]></content>

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[每个人都有自己认为绝对正确的事情。 选择自己的生活方式并且不受到别人的干扰对于我自己来说才是最重要的。 所以别人怎样是不重要的，最重要的是成为自己。 就算是固步自封也好，墨守陈规也罢。 safety zone里的世界的确很舒适。 大概这是我脑子里突然想到的一个很重要的命题。 不同人有不同的境遇罢了。 所以看到别人的境况也不必羡慕，却也不必怜悯。 因为那都不是我自己。 我的过去造就了我的现在，我又从现在走向将来。 一步步走下去其实正确答案就在自己的手里。 好不容易到手的机会，现在停下来真的太可惜了。 然后就是，我对现在的生活状况还算比较满意吧。 お仕事と推し事都能如愿以偿地进行。 并不是一点迷茫都没有，但是却能选择自己想要的东西。 大概这样几年来的努力某种程度上也算有了回报。 选择喜欢的偶像，选择喜欢的东西。 以前想要去见面，熬半年一年都没法出头。 杳无音讯一周又一周。 以后如果还能这样下去那就是万幸了。 结论： 做自己喜欢的自己。]]></content>

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[前言&amp;吐槽写这一篇的计划从昨晚拖到早上，早上舍友到现在还没有起来，所以打算用手机看一下安排今天做什么。之前为了方便一直用的ios自带提醒事项+microsoft to-do来安排，microsoft to-do的ui我很喜欢，ios自带也能接受。但是这个同步真的很是问题，所以早上起来折腾了以下奇妙清单。不过整理的时候发现同步挺快，可能是我设置的问题，所以就容忍它最后一次 iGEM昨天在看了dance巡演ust部分之后去了iGEM的Information session。iGEM对于我来说是不陌生的，我的若干个朋友都有参与其中（数量之多让我惊奇）。所以比起其他人我更能直接了解到其中的运作和workload。 不过话说回来，在咨询几位大佬之后，就算后续有退出倾向我觉得也是可以原谅自己的。 Major首先，关于未来的发展方向，这是这一周考虑的很多的事情。 最初的梦想是化学与食品。但是发现自己比起格物致知更喜欢学以致用。 食品的梦想是要追的，雀巢不是说说。 不过昨天在知乎上看到一个说法：比起销售人员，产品研发人员更容易被取代。 这个和我个人一直以来的认知是不一样的。我个人认为，销售是谁都可以去做大，但是研发是要有专业知识和操作水平的人才能胜任的。而且研发掌握着技术，销售并不是。某种程度上是这样的，研发转销售容易，但是销售转研发难。 但是我忽略的侧面是，国情看来，现在的研发人员供过于求，而且主要是技术研发而非创新研发，也就是说说一个大学毕业生都可以完成的工作，并没有必要高薪请所谓“专家”。 所以，像现在一些大手食品企业的管理者也是身兼开发背景也不足为奇，只有两手并抓才能坐到最好。 那么从这个角度看，我原来的专注而单纯的想法是不足而取的。 另外一个，是关于化学与生物工程部门的化工和生工。 时至今日我还是没有能够特别区分我们学校的这两个专业的办法。但是感觉上从各种角度来说，现在对bioengineering感觉更看好一点，我觉得这个还是要摒弃之前的想法，值得自己好好考虑的。 毕竟bioengineering也有data analysis的部分，也能满足我对CS的兴趣。 结论参加iGEM，但是对于自己commitment要把握有数。 CBE你好，可以让我看得更清楚吗。 积极安排自己的schedule，希望能够在保证化学功底的基础上，适当接触CS知识。 了解，但不偏相信。 后记第一次整理自己的想法，感觉大多数主要内容还是在脑内还有微信交流完成的，并没有好好地记录自己的心路历程。但是得出了适当的结果，也不失为一次尝试。 补充其实昨天还有想到一些想法，一个是关于自己以后的wota活安排另外一个就是自己的语言学习安排。 以后会从事不一样的工作，但是掌握语言是终身受益的东西，希望自己能够成为像长辈一样优秀的多语言者。 资格证书的考试是适当的激励自己的办法。]]></content>

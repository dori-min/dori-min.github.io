    <content><![CDATA[<p><em>考前的一些迷惑总结</em></p>
<h1 id="PID-controller-design-Direct-Synthesis-amp-Internal-Model"><a href="#PID-controller-design-Direct-Synthesis-amp-Internal-Model" class="headerlink" title="PID controller design - Direct Synthesis &amp; Internal Model"></a>PID controller design - Direct Synthesis &amp; Internal Model</h1><p>controller tuning就是configuration的意思</p>
<p><em>以下内容对应DS和IM部分的图片一起看</em></p>
<p><img src="https://d3i71xaburhd42.cloudfront.net/fe7b95cdbf0c26c9fc05de227f10473b3b5fa2d8/2-Figure1-1.png" alt="img"></p>
<p>Direct Synthesis很简单粗暴，根据表达式，要求Gc就一定要先确定Y,Ysp,G，前两个虽然可以直接获得，但是不是它们想要多少就多少，而是我们有一个希望的(Y/Ysp)_d的比例，而G我们就需要算一个model G~代进去，这里G可以用之前章节得内容测得K和τ(如果是2nd order就τ1,τ2)，经过一系列代入和简化得到了P11,P12上面controller的Kc和τ_I(&amp;τ_D)表达式，这个缺点就是换一个G就要重新算一遍。</p>
<p><img src="https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/3-s2.0-B9781437778076100191-f19-10-9781437778076.jpg" alt="img"></p>
<p>Internal Model的操作方法就是一边过着真实发生的的流程G，一边simulate着一个model G~ ，并且利用两者输出的差，经过反复实验和调整，使得G~完全等价于G，这个时候Gc方才上限，利用算出来的model G~可以算出Gc<em>，就是我们要的Gc</em>了<br>在流程上，G和G~ 是齐头并进，但是实际操作，G~ 和Gc<em> 通过这一系列步骤组成了我们想要的controller，就算我们把G换掉，G~和Gc</em>的组合仍然能够通过着一系列操作获得我们想要的controller效果</p>
<h1 id="Offset-of-controller"><a href="#Offset-of-controller" class="headerlink" title="Offset of controller"></a>Offset of controller</h1><p>P的offset就是因为P只看到了控制那个时候的情况，但是没有考虑过去，没有弥补error，所以永远达不到想要的目标<br>I可以看到过去，所以可以消除offset，但是会因为太执着弥补，所以会有wind up<br>D是冲动的急性子，所以不能单独/只和P搭配使用，因为看到一点error就会上天，一定要让I压着（补充）才能按耐住。</p>
<h1 id="Integral-windup"><a href="#Integral-windup" class="headerlink" title="Integral windup"></a>Integral windup</h1><p>原因：真实控制器都有上限，比如电压上限是5V，但是超过5V的set point就没办法到达，但是controller又希望要这么高的电压来control error，所以integral controller就眼睁睁地看着error累计变多，它就更想要control了，就出现了用力过猛的现象</p>
<blockquote>
<p>若因為實際系統的限制，控制器的輸出無法再影響控制變數，此時即為積分飽和的情形，例如輸出為0-5V的系統，理想的輸出在5V和6V之間變化，但實際輸出均維持在5V，這段控制器的輸出無法再影響控制變數，即為積分飽和。需要等理想輸出低於5V以下時，實際輸出會隨理想輸出變化，控制器的輸出無法再影響控制變數。控制器中若有積分器，其累計輸出的變化會隨積分時間而不同，若積分時間長時，其變化較慢，因此此現象會很明顯。</p>

    <title>19~20 Spring 学期总结</title>
    <url>/200525-Summary-of-19-20spring/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>本来想在所有考完之后再做一个所有课的repo，不过今天考完了4130有感就提前写一下。</p>
<p>目前结束了的有分化、有机和刚刚考完的工厂设计与经济。</p>
<hr>
<h1 id="分析化学"><a href="#分析化学" class="headerlink" title="分析化学"></a>分析化学</h1><p>最后的考试基本还是达到预期，就是“我能学进去这么多了，我也就考这么多”，因为的确这门课我没有get到太多的内容。唯一要感谢的就是他早早结束了final，减轻复习压力。</p>
<hr>
<h1 id="有机化学"><a href="#有机化学" class="headerlink" title="有机化学"></a>有机化学</h1><p>感觉也是类似，最后的几个章节过得比较快，很多东西都没记熟，但是偏偏有机就是要记得牢才能熟能生巧的学科，但是总体来说，翻看自己的笔记，还是有挺多收获，起码和高中的很多知识串起来了。</p>
<p><em>最后final的分数还是比较满意的，合成做对了，选择题也没有错那么多，虽然网上看85以上就有绝对龟A+，最后给到A（最后只给了俩A+）也满意了</em></p>
<hr>
<h1 id="工厂设计与经济"><a href="#工厂设计与经济" class="headerlink" title="工厂设计与经济"></a>工厂设计与经济</h1><p>的前半部分经济没有学懂，期中考试翻车；本来想着期末偏工程的部分要翻盘回来，但是感觉考试时间还是紧，好不容易MC终于突破60~70%的魔咒，从来都是要磨到最后三十秒才交的我这次提前五分钟就交了，结果也比较理想。<br>到了大题就开始吃紧——看到第一题是经济，果断跳过；<br>第二题是pressure relief，除了第二问比较陌生（但是也可以抄课件的内容）没有什么问题，第三题看着我就蒙了，因为这里我做的练习的确不多，只是看了答案都是代公式，但是我一直在纠结到底用哪个公式（plume/puff，which stability）然后又不明白在问什么，先跳过了。<br>第四题hazop就是写写写，感觉还行，小插曲是中途笔芯没了；<br>第五题的event tree比较懵的点是occur B times a year，要说one in XXX times我还能理解，但是这种表述是什么含义，在这一点又纠结了。第二问是经济，是我不擅长的部分，到最后要考虑Time value还是没算出来，到最后只剩下十分钟回去第三题的（这里的一个错误决策就是耗时间在最后一题第二问的经济，毕竟一个大题是20分，一个小题是10分，其实是不划算的，而且比起经济题目我应该更擅长工程类题目）所以收场的感觉就是时间分配不是很好，要是再多半小时可能plume/puff能做出来。所以说这门课还是有不少遗憾的吧，还是有没有学懂的地方。<br>做不到问心无愧，因为不能说尽了全力，只能说吸取教训再接再厉。</p>
<hr>
<h1 id="流程动态与控制"><a href="#流程动态与控制" class="headerlink" title="流程动态与控制"></a>流程动态与控制</h1><p><strong>拉普拉斯套娃</strong></p>
<p>应该是这学期学的最顺的课。一开始两节课觉得“这也太无聊了吧”，从拉普拉斯开始慢慢进入动态的世界，到各种TF，再到controller。</p>
<p>这堂课最好的点在于，上课内容、作业、考试都是一脉相承，没有脱节，所以学起来就比较轻松，实属难得，最后final也不是很难，可能容错率会比较低。</p>
<hr>
<h1 id="热力学"><a href="#热力学" class="headerlink" title="热力学"></a>热力学</h1><p><em>记得积heat capacity里的T噢</em></p>
<p>我觉得我没有“那么”用心——水着看过了很多video，但是第一次独立做对作业还是很欣喜的。教授是厉害的教授，可能是因为我水过了video，所以我对整套体系的理解其实并没有很顺利，中间经历了很多次卡壳，和隔壁流体力学相比，热力学的概念多样而且复杂，要把这些概念整理明白要工夫。也多亏了每堂课的quiz，所以虽然有卡壳但是也不是特别拖沓地学，总归来说还是挺好的一门课。而且像这门课这么完整的答案和例题实属难得（对比起来别的课的答案就写的跟什么一样）。</p>
<p>最后final没考好，只过mean一点点点，主要炸的是化学平衡——本来我以为我最擅长的部分，只能说可惜吧。</p>
<hr>
<h1 id="流体力学"><a href="#流体力学" class="headerlink" title="流体力学"></a>流体力学</h1><p>一门不知道怎么说的课。一开始还在兴致勃勃听课，还在努力预习，到一般多就开始走自己的路了。上课、作业、考试完全是三回事。期中特别简单。期末就很魔鬼。魔鬼的地方在于：<br>1、其实主要就是control volume的概念，虽然平时都有强调，但是我不确定他这么教大家能不能真的明白怎么做，反正我是没明白；<br>2、作业只是代代数字，考试基本不用算什么数字，脱节很大。</p>
<p>考试目前除了第一part的成绩，我觉得还算可以。最后大题我能写出结果的有四道半，这是多亏了从隔壁部门流体力学拿来的题目。因为我们自己给的pastpaper的答案太烂了，不仅错误百出，而且完全看不懂。隔壁的虽然也不如热力学那样天衣无缝，但是总归对CV一类问题的解答是有启发的，而且和final有一两道题目有特别相近的。</p>
<p>毕竟到最后已经没有什么时间曲做系统的复习了，只能做exam oriented的学习，我觉得对此流体力学的应用效果是最明显的。我想这也是个考试的诀窍吧。</p>
<p><em>200612：心心念念终于出龟了，这学期唯一一个A+我死而无憾（？）了</em></p>
<hr>
<h1 id="C"><a href="#C" class="headerlink" title="C++"></a>C++</h1><p>reg这门课就经历了“wl第10→进不去→实在进不去→狠心drop再reg”，开学之前看完了video，正式课上了两堂而已，但是lab和assignment都有好好做，起码99%内容都是独立做出来的，所以感觉自己debug能力之类的还是有。</p>
<p>做到pp傻眼，因为很多概念不清楚，不过幸好这次没有MC和TF，所以逃过一劫，写大题的时候有时间分配上面的失策，下次注意吧。<em>出分补充一下：Pastpaper真的很重要！</em></p>
<h1 id="Appendix-流体力学串讲"><a href="#Appendix-流体力学串讲" class="headerlink" title="Appendix 流体力学串讲"></a>Appendix 流体力学串讲</h1><p><em>复习的时候瞎写的</em></p>
<p>流体力学串讲。实在需要整理了。</p>
<p>两个核心，Mass Balance(Conservation)和Energy Balance。<br>思路：由静到动，2D&amp;3D。</p>
<p>2 液体性质 3 液体压力——都是静态<br>4 kinematics 开始动起来了，但是也只是单纯研究速度和加速度<br>4.4祭出了大杀器RTT，RTT最重要的一点就是把CS和CV联系起来<br>其实我觉得CV是好测的，因为CS是会动的，CV你就搁那儿就好</p>
<p>5其实就是用RTT把EB和MB表达一遍<br>然后伯努利横空出世。<br>伯努利的本质其实就是EB。<br>EB是个很大的饼，表达方式千百样，要看最适合眼下问题的是什么样。<br>伯努利就是最适合流体——为了流体应运而生的一种表达方式。<br>然后伯努利的各种变形，尤其是head形式，最重要的是为了应用和测量方便，参考之前说的head。</p>
<blockquote>
<p>以前一直不理解head这个概念是什么意思<br>现在似乎明白了<br>因为伯努利的能量形式，能量，看不见摸不到测不了<br>压力计其实也是转换<br>还不如来个直接的 head，长度单位，拿个管子一查，拿个尺子量一量就有了<br>妙啊</p>
<p>我上初中的时候经常有这个问题——为什么存在【压强】的概念，压力不好用吗。 第一，无法测量，对于固体来说压力好理解，但是对于流体来说，流体压力的本质是流体分子的不断碰撞，这是很难测量的。<br>第二，可视化具体说明，针能扎得深是因为压强大，根据初中一系列海绵方块实验，压强是可以看到的。</p>
</blockquote>
<p>6Momentum。<br>其实动量是个很神奇的东西。<br>他是牛顿第二定律的另外一种表达形式，但是它存在一个“守恒”在里面。<br>就像我们不会有加速度守恒，也没有力的守恒，但是存在了动量守恒，真实不可思议。</p>
<p>说到动量不让它转一转感觉过不去，毕竟大多数化工机械都是旋转的pump啦turbine啦，所以这里要讨论一下旋转的情况。</p>
<p>7的dimensional analysis要不是看了油管影片真的是学的没头没脑。其实也是一个简化运算的过程。老板肯定希望省事的，最后model和prototype的similarity也是应用的体现。</p>
<p>8 Internal flow我们终于终于进到管子里面啦，在管子里就和在外面不一样啦分laminar turbulent，会有各种摩擦 loss，这就很好理解啦。</p>
<p>附赠一个copy的流体力学重点内容list：</p>

    <content><![CDATA[<h1 id="Preface"><a href="#Preface" class="headerlink" title="Preface"></a>Preface</h1><p>有些东西【只是数学关系】。<br>有些东西比起【数学形式】更加需要思考【物理意义】.</p>
<p>工程原则：简化测量，简化运算，自圆其说。</p>
<p>每一个“非自然变量”(除 V, T, N等等可以被自然获得和感知)，都是我们对每一件事背后真相的探索的里程碑。</p>
<p>中间一大段中文懒得翻译了<del>反正不会有人看</del>，就扔在这里吧。</p>
<h1 id="Basics-Concepts"><a href="#Basics-Concepts" class="headerlink" title="Basics Concepts"></a>Basics Concepts</h1><p><u><strong>Steady state</strong></u> = No accumulation</p>
<p><strong><u>Equilibrium</u></strong> = No change with time</p>
<p><strong><u>State Function</u></strong> = Path Independent</p>
<p>Intensive/Extensive Properties = Whether properties change with mass/amount</p>
<p><strong><u>Simple System assumption</u></strong> is necessary for almost all conclusion we make.</p>
<p>State postulate，Intensive state</p>
<p><em>PV图上都是可逆过程，表示不出不可逆过程，不可逆过程最好看TS图。</em></p>
<h1 id="Ideal-Gas-Law"><a href="#Ideal-Gas-Law" class="headerlink" title="Ideal Gas Law"></a>Ideal Gas Law</h1><p>For the famous formula $PV=RT$ , $V$ is molar volume whose unit is $L/mol$.<br>Though <u>mathematically</u> it is extra step (since the exercises always give $\underline{V}$ and $N$ instead of $V$ directly. But the <u>physical</u> meaning is that in collaborate <u>two Extensive Properties</u>  into <u>a single Intensive property</u>. For condition of well-mixed open system, we don’t have to consider the mole change if we use $V$.</p>
<h1 id="First-Law"><a href="#First-Law" class="headerlink" title="First Law"></a>First Law</h1><p>Remember that U is state function and W,Q are process variable</p>
<p>Reversibility, Dissipation, Quasi-static are better to be discussed in Second Law.</p>
<hr>
<p>For MATHEMITICAL CONVENIENCE，we then introduce $C_V$, $C_P$</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="Calculation-of-internal-energy"><a href="#Calculation-of-internal-energy" class="headerlink" title="Calculation of internal energy"></a>Calculation of internal energy</h2><p>$U=U(T,V)$,<em>($T$ is the macroscopic value measuring average molecular kinetic energy，$V$ is the macroscopic value measuring average molecular kinetic energy)</em></p>
<p>Here we still don’t know the expression for internal energy, but we can use the approach of <strong>【Derivative and Integration】</strong>, if we are not able to measure the whole value directly, then somehow we measure the changes.</p>
<p>$dU=(\frac{\partial U}{\partial T})_V+(\frac{\partial U}{\partial V})_T$ . Then for <strong>【Ideal Gas】</strong>$U=U(T)$，$(\frac{\partial U}{\partial V})_T=0$</p>
<p>Therefore $(\frac{\partial U}{\partial T})_V \equiv C_V$</p>
<p>Though it is called <strong>constant-volume heat capacity</strong>，$dU=C_V dT$ not only applicable to isochoric condition. It is a <strong>UNIVERSAL</strong> expression. It is called <strong>CONSTANT-VOLUME</strong> only because when we calculate partial derivative, we need to set other variable to be constant.</p>
<p>To understand its physical meaning,  in real life <em>（and in most exercise）</em> processes are irreversible. For two state of ideal gas $U_1, U_2$，the core of state function is <strong>PATH INDEPENDENT</strong>. Therefore we can imagine an isobaric reversible process and calculate the change of internal energy. It is same as the irreversible process, since they have same initial and final state.</p>
<h2 id="Calculation-of-Work"><a href="#Calculation-of-Work" class="headerlink" title="Calculation of Work"></a>Calculation of Work</h2><p>Remember that W is path independent. So $𝛿𝑊 = −𝑃𝑑\underline{V}$ only applicable for Quasi-static。If it is sudden expansion, $P$ is environment pressure.</p>
<h2 id="Calculation-of-Heat"><a href="#Calculation-of-Heat" class="headerlink" title="Calculation of Heat"></a>Calculation of Heat</h2><p>The trick of First Law lies in that you cannot calculate heat directly but only through First Law.</p>
<h2 id="Enthalpy"><a href="#Enthalpy" class="headerlink" title="Enthalpy"></a>Enthalpy</h2><p><em>高中化学选修四对于所有的反应热都用的是$\Delta H$，但是我记得的是一定有恒压这个条件，反应焓变才等于反应热。上了大学之后才开始真正思考焓变到底是什么。</em></p>
<p>最后发现这个问题压根没有意义。因为最好理解焓的方式就是把它当成一个为了【数学计算方便】而产生的量。</p>
<p>具体来说，就是我们经常需要计算Q，所以我们就经常要算U+PV，嫌麻烦所以有了H，同样地，为了计算H的方便，所以才有了$C_P$，有了$dH=C_PdT$</p>
<p>刚好在open system的first law也可以写成H的形式，形式简单，而且可以用$C_P$计算，何乐而不为。</p>
<h2 id="Tricks"><a href="#Tricks" class="headerlink" title="Tricks"></a>Tricks</h2><p>For transient system, remember we can convert $d\underline{U}$ to $dU$ and $dN$ and then integrate.</p>
<h1 id="Second-Law"><a href="#Second-Law" class="headerlink" title="Second Law"></a>Second Law</h1><p>Second Law mainly discussed about the <strong>direction</strong> of process, and how we define, describe and measure the process.</p>
<h2 id="Heat-engine-and-Carnot"><a href="#Heat-engine-and-Carnot" class="headerlink" title="Heat engine and Carnot"></a>Heat engine and Carnot</h2><p>Heat engine = convert HEAT to WORK</p>
<p>Carnot engine set up the maximum of efficiency for heat engine.</p>
<p>卡诺热机的公式以及重要的$ \frac{|Q_H|}{|Q_C|} = \frac{T_H}{T_C} $。其实仔细想想这个公式还挺神奇的，Q是过程量，T是状态量，却能够在数量关系划等号。中间有一个重要的【数学】步骤就是四个状态的体积的比例关系。</p>
<p>这个体积关系在PV图上的几何意义是，不同等温线上的两点连线却是平行的。所以说一开始学卡诺的时候觉得很奇怪，因为以前至知道在PV图上横平竖直地走，比如迪赛尔，卡诺开始却要斜着跨过等温线，没有地方是直线的，而现在看来，“直线”其实是隐藏在其中的。</p>
<p>另外关于卡诺热机为什么是天花板，不用反证法的话，<a href="https://www.zhihu.com/question/22702847" target="_blank" rel="external">这个解答</a>的解释比较好——不能从PV图（因为PV图只能反映可逆过程），而是要从TS图中找到答案。</p>
<h2 id="Entropy"><a href="#Entropy" class="headerlink" title="Entropy"></a>Entropy</h2><p>做定性分析，熵衡量混乱程度，越混乱则熵越大。<br>顺带一提，熵是一个状态量，这也很好理解，熵就是一个状态，该有多乱有多乱，无论怎么变来变去，有这么乱就是这么乱。</p>
<p>这样很好理解，但是不定量分析的话，我们就无法衡量一个系统的混乱度有没有变化。</p>
<p>微观的熵的表达式，$\underline{S}=k_B ln \Omega$ 其中$\Omega$ 是微观状态的数目。对这个公式定性分析的话很好理解，可能情况越多那就意味着越混乱，<em>关于怎么和宏观联系起来我还在思考。</em></p>
<p>宏观的乍一看不知道怎么做，那就先假设有这样找一个熵不变的过程，找它的起始和终点，然后看看这个过程中有什么量不变，那它就是熵了。</p>
<p>但是再我们量化熵之前，我们根本没法比较两个状态的熵是不是一样了，那我们只能跟原状态比较——既然熵是状态量，和自己比那肯定一样了吧。<br>那这样一个起点是自己、终点也是自己的过程，我们叫做一个cyclic process。于是，我们要找一个cyclic process中一个不变的状态量。</p>
<p>很巧的是，卡诺循环是个cyclic process，卡诺定理我们发现 $\delta Q/T$ 是不变的，所以我们定义为熵。</p>
<p><em>（这个自圆其说看上去强词夺理甚至有点无厘头，但是是我到此为止的一个理解了）</em></p>
<p>虽然有了定义式，但是熵的计算也要讲究，一定要分成系统和reservoir两种情况，原因且看下文。</p>
<h2 id="Calculation-of-Second-law"><a href="#Calculation-of-Second-law" class="headerlink" title="Calculation of Second law"></a>Calculation of Second law</h2><p>回到最初的问题，我们要看系统的混乱度也就是熵有没有变化，那既然有了个等式就可以计算了。</p>
<p>前人总结出了second law的文字表述，再把这个意思变成公式，一句话概括second law的公式就是【孤立系统熵增】。用公式表达就是$d\underline{S}&gt;=0$</p>
<p>但是，我们生活中哪里有那么多孤立系统，那没办法，对于open system，只好把inflow和outflow带来的熵变、还有所研究的系统以外的整个宇宙的熵变也考虑进去，这样我们才能算出来系统的熵变。</p>
<p>关于system本身的熵变，可以假设system进行的是reversible(in this case, quasi-static)的过程，这样 就可以用W=PV计算功，再假设ideal gas，U也可以算出来，就可以算出Q，就可以算出S。</p>
<p>这个时候就要考虑到系统以外的整个宇宙——也就是所谓的环境，对于系统来说也就是reservoir——的熵变。直接算是不可能的，因为公式里的$\delta Q$ 得要用 $d\underline{U}$ 算吧，$d\underline{U}=NC_VdT$，对那么大的环境（宇宙）来说，$N\rightarrow \infty, dT\rightarrow 0$，没有办法直接算。<br>所以看系统给环境多少Q。<br>但是系统算 $Q$ 是我们假设reversible了，但是环境我们怎么知道是不是reversible呢。于是这里在note里定义了环境是mechanical reversible，这样就可以保证系统的 $Q$ 可以代进去算了。</p>
<p>至于inflow和outflow，就分别算$S<em>{in}n</em>{in}, S<em>{out}n</em>{out}$就好了<em>（题目会给）（装死.jpg）</em></p>
<h2 id="Exergy"><a href="#Exergy" class="headerlink" title="Exergy"></a>Exergy</h2><p>让我们先回到卡诺热机，为什么会有这个天花板在？有人就提出了，能量不仅有多少（量）也是有优劣（质）的。</p>
<blockquote>
<p>能量“质”的指标是根据它的做功能力来判断的，因此，可以根据能量转换能力将能量分为三种来行。</p>
<ol>
<li>可以完全转换的能量，如机械能、电能等。理论上可以百分之百地转换成其他形式地能量。这种能量的“量”和“质”完全统一，它的转换能力不受约束。</li>
<li>可部分转换的能量，如热量、内能等，这种能量的“量”和“质”不完全统一，它的转换能力受热力学第二定律约束。</li>
<li>不能转换的能量，如环境内能，这种能量只有“量”没有“质”。</li>
</ol>
<p>（摘抄自《工程热力学》）</p>
</blockquote>
<p>于是除了按照能量的产生和存在分为机械能、电能、内能等以外，我们又有了新的区分能量的办法。<em>（但是要注意这里还是人为的定义，是能源学科为了区分能源质量做出的定义。）</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>能量=㶲+㷻</p>
<p>Energy=Exergy+Anergy</p>
</blockquote>
<p>问题来了，我们怎么知道有用能——㶲有多少呢。</p>
<p>㶲其实就是卡诺热机做了多少功。</p>
<p>因为卡诺热机实际不存在，首先的首先我们不可能直接测出来。</p>
<p>卡诺热机是个可逆热机，是把内能转化成机械能等其他能量的。气体膨胀的PV公式是不能用的（为什么），没办法直接算，所以我们要用First Law算。但是我们没办法知道Q有多少，但是这个时候我们有Second Law， 我们可以得出一个Steady state, Reversible的系统有$\frac{\dot{Q}<em>{rev}}{T}+(S</em>{in}-S<em>{out})\dot{n}=0$ ，这样我们知道了$S</em>{in}$和$S_{out}$就可以算$Q$了。这样代回First Law我们就可以算卡诺热机的功了。</p>
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\dot{W}_{ideal}=[(H_{out}-T_rS_{out})-(H_{in}-T_rS_{in})]\dot{n}</script><p>解释这个式子，就是inflow其实有点能量，但是outflow有更多㶲，过程可逆（没有能量耗散），所以这个差值乘 $\dot{n}$ 就是卡诺热机的有用功。也就是所谓的ideal shaft work。</p>
<p>同时，我们把个表达式定义为㶲 $X$ ，在【数值上】等于$H-TS$。</p>

<h1 id="Phases"><a href="#Phases" class="headerlink" title="Phases"></a>Phases</h1><p>In the first half semester we have already discussed about purity(mainly gases) and mostly about intensive properties. Then we turn to liquid, and mixtures and how their properties change if we change their P, T, V etc.</p>
<p>First thing to talk about is the deviation of <u>liquid</u> from ideal gas. We still hope to use ideal gas law (it is so convenient), therefore:<br>(1) we introduce $\beta$ and $\kappa$ mainly to discuss the incompressibility of liquid.<br>(2) since we usually regard liquid can not be compressed arbitrarily, we realize that the molar volume cannot be determined through ideal gas law. Empirical formula help us measure molar volume for liquid. </p>
<p>(We seldom discuss solid here)Since we already have two phases, we now discuss <u>Phase Behavior</u>. We want to determine the properties(P,T,V) of each phase<br>(1)First of all Gibbs’ Phase Rule 𝐹 = 2 + 𝑛 − 𝜋 − 𝑟 tell us how many intensive properties we need to determine multiple phases(and even multiple components)<br>(2)We need to know the T or V or P where the two phases interchange. That gives us $P^{sat}$ (saturated)<strong><u>vapor pressure</u></strong> (can be determined through empirical formula called <u>Antoine Equation</u>), $T^{sat}$, or so-called <strong><u>boiling point</u></strong>.<br>(3) We have known the boundary,  then when the substance goes across the boundary of phases, it need to absorb/exert heat, which is called <u>latent heat</u>. It can be determined through <u>Clapeyron equation</u> and its empirical correlation.<br>(4) We learn from Chemistry before that everything process is actually incomplete. Somehow equilibrium exists. It is so for chemical reaction and same for phases interchange. Equilibrium means that even S does not change. By expressing $d\underline{S}=0$, we get $(\frac{\underline{G}^L}{T^L}-\frac{\underline{G}^V}{T^V})dN^L=0$</p>
<p>(这里有个因果关系，因为括号里等于零(能量差)（这里不是真正意义上的能量，但是单位是能量的单位），所以才有平衡，才有dN=0)</p>
<p>（还有一个就是我们之前定义的三个equilibrium在这里终于派上用场！其实我们想要的就是N平衡也就是diffusional equilibrium）</p>
<p>By the way we learn to read those complicated thermodynamics diagram. Mainly, P-T and P-V diagrams.</p>
<h1 id="Mixture"><a href="#Mixture" class="headerlink" title="Mixture"></a>Mixture</h1><p>For <strong><u>mixture</u></strong>, we (1) define  $x_i, y_i$ for liquid and gas components respectively, and (2)develop another idealized model called ideal gas mixture. (3)Since the properties are not same each part of the mixture, we finally need to turn to <u>extensive properties</u>. We compare the <u>fundamental equations</u> we derive for extensive properties and those for intensive ones, we found that they are different by  $(U+PV-TS)dN$. We call molar $U+PV-TS$ by <u>Chemical potential</u><em>(we will explain what does it physically mean later)</em> Now we can express extensive properties with chemical potential, which is more convenient.</p>
<p>Then, <u>how to find chemical potential for different states</u>.<br>We know that we can express it in U, G, A etc, holding different variable constant. In real situation, it is easiest for us to hold T and P constant (so we choose G), correspondingly, we can express chemical potential of ideal gas as $\mu^{ig}<em>{i} = G</em>{i}^{ig}+RTln(y_i)$ and similar form for ideal solution.<br>For gases, we have residual properties to compensate the difference from ideal gas. Similarly, for liquid, we have <u>excess properties</u> to compensate the difference from ideal solution.</p>
<p>Finally, we are able to determine the properties of components of mixtures.</p>
<p>Before ending, we will discuss about the physical meaning of chemical potential. In lecture notes, it write like this</p>
<blockquote>
<p>• It is related to (but not exactly) the “concentration” of a substance. <strong>Matter moves from region of high chemical potential to low chemical potential.</strong><br>• At diffusional equilibrium, the chemical potential is exactly balanced.<br>• Note the parallelism<br>(𝑇 : thermal equilibrium : heat)<br>(𝑃 : mechanical equilibrium : work)<br>(𝜇 : diffusional equilibrium : flow of matter).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Similar to voltage (or better understanding by Chinese terminology ‘electrical pressure’), current flow from high voltage to low voltage. Same as chemical potential. <u>matter flows</u> from high chemical potential to low chemical potential. Remind the change can be both chemical and physical <em>(fundamentally, not much difference from the aspect of energy changes, but people like to differentiate them)</em></p>
<h1 id="Fugacity"><a href="#Fugacity" class="headerlink" title="Fugacity"></a>Fugacity</h1><p>First of all, fugacity is a surrogate function for the chemical potential because the drawbacks of chemical potential as followings:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>• It is negatively infinite when pressure approaches zero (i.e. at ideal gas limit).<br>• It is negatively infinite when the mole fraction approaches zero (i.e. at the infinite dilution limit).<br>• It is on an arbitrary scale like internal energy, and only the difference in chemical potential (not the absolute value) is meaningful.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We seek for more practical appliance of what we have defined before, unfortunately, chemical potential is hard to be measured directly, but it is so important to obtain its value for calculating. Therefore, engineers define another property called <strong><u>fugacity</u></strong> to replace it. (1) Fugacity is attributed with the unit of pressure, make it fairly easy to be measured. (2) Fugacity is defined as the deviation of chemical potential <em>(RT and exponential can be simply treated as conversion of unit)</em> from $\mu<em>{ref}$, where $$\mu</em>{ref}=\mu^{ig}_i(T,P=1bar,y_i=1)=G^{ig}_i(T,P=1bar,y_i=1)$$ Again, we get back to G, we can be measured with the help of properties relation. Then we only need to measure fugacity to everything we want.</p>
<p>The measurement of fugacity is divided to many cases. (1) For ideal gas, it simply equals to pressure at the same state<br>(2) for non-ideal gas, a revise parameter or <strong><u>fugacity coefficient $\phi$</u></strong> is multiplied to pressure<br>(3) For liquid, f is equal to vapor pressure at this temperature.<br>(4) For ideal mixtures, just multiplied by component. (remark: there is an idea called ‘gaseous ideal solutions’)<br>(5) For gases in non ideal mixtures, expression is more or less the same, while for liquids $\hat{f_i}=a_if_i$, where $a_i$ is the <strong><u>activity of i</u></strong>. It can also be expressed in $a_i = x_i\gamma_i$, where $\gamma_i$ the <strong><u>activity coefficient</u></strong> of 𝑖.</p>
<p>Eventually, our approach to get the macroscopic properties of mixtures work, now we are going to analyze through, diagram. We look into P-x-y diagram and T-x-y diagram.</p>
<p>In real life, sometimes we cannot determine component of mixture directly. <strong><u>Raoult’s Law</u></strong>, which illustrate the relationship of $y_i, x_i, P, P^{sat}$ <em>(where pressure are easily obtained)</em>give a convenient way to obtain component of Binary mixture. Basically, we have the Raoult’s Law for two of the components. Two unknown variables and two equations. We can easily solve for unknowns. Remark that Raoult’s Law has a bunch of restrictions so take care when applying.</p>
<p>If we have more than two component, we can conduct what is called <strong><u>Flash Calculation</u></strong>, in which process we introduced variable $ℒ, 𝒱$, and $z_i=ℒx_i+𝒱y_i$. I personally regards it as mathematical tricks. So I will skips the formula here.</p>
<p>We mentioned the strict restrictions for Raoult’s Law. For air and many other gases they actually violates the law. Therefore we introduce Henry’s Law, which is in similar form to Raoult’s Law, but $P^{sat}$ replaced by $ℋ_i$, Henry’s Constants, which we could find through literature.</p>
<p>Realizing the strict condition of Raoult’s Law, we modified it for liquid a bit with $\gamma_i$.</p>
<p>By the way for Azeotropes we have $x_i=y_i$</p>
<h1 id="Chemical-reaction-and-equilibrium"><a href="#Chemical-reaction-and-equilibrium" class="headerlink" title="Chemical reaction and equilibrium"></a>Chemical reaction and equilibrium</h1><p>Finally, we chemical engineers build up the bridge between mechanical engineering and chemistry. We are to analyze how energy affect reaction. Actually this part should be the focus of another course called “reaction engineering” and now we are pathing our way to it.</p>
<p>First, combining stoichiometry (actually, mass balance) and 1st law (energy balance) and require $d\underline{S}=0$, we realize that <u>Gibbs Free Energy</u> and <u>chemical potential</u> imply the direction of reaction. <em>(we may have already known this in high school, but we only learned about the conclusion but don’t know why then)</em>. Then we define <u>equilibrium constant K</u>, which can be obtained by standard <u>Gibbs free energy of reaction</u> $\Delta_rG^0$, which can be determined through <u>Gibbs free energy of formation and combustion</u></p>
<p>Le Châtelier’s Principle(very simple so simply skip it this topic)</p>

    <title>论中医</title>
    <url>/200508-herb-medicine/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>其实化工的很多东西，比如热力学和动力学的一些公式，都是经验公式，没有太多的物理意义。 </p>
<p>而对比中医，中医也只是经验模型，其实从这一点上两者差别不大。 那么我个人反感中医的原因是，知道是经验公式，还试图从其中挖掘原因，用五行阴阳等完全不属于现代科学的理论去解释，某种程度上很荒谬。 而且，化工的系统比生理系统简单，更容易被预测，很多解释虽然不是真正的科学，但是可以从实践和统计上被证明可行。还有，作为工程学，能够被量化是不可或缺的特性。</p>
<p>看到这样一个说法觉得很有道理。 <strong><u>医学不等于科学</u></strong>，医学分两大类，基础医学和临床医学，两者有很大交集，但是目标不一样，基础医学是应用科学（化学、生物）的方法搞明白病理药理来从源头攻破，临床医学只有一个目的，就是把人治好，中医因为长期有大量有疗效的案例，所以才会被广泛采用。</p>
<p>所以在这个时候，我们不谈论原理的科学与否，我们只关心这一套知识体系是否有疗效。换句话来说，西医也有很多力不从心的部分，这个时候没有优劣，能把人只好的就是对的，这是临床的逻辑。从这个角度来说，中医能够存续千年，也似乎是有道理的。</p>

    <title>请回答1988</title>
    <url>/200322-Reply-1998/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>看了一个下午的1988算是咸鱼到极限了。 为了适当减少愧疚感，写一点观后感输出一下吧。 一开始是看木鱼水心的视频，其实没有特别喜欢，因为人物性格太过夸张，而且一开始见到这么多人还没有分清。但是后来接受了一系列设定之后就真香了。<br>个人最磕的还是宝拉善宇这一对，虽然有些恬不知耻，但是还是在宝拉身上看到了很多自己的影子，无论是在对待学习还是在对待感情。一开始其实最不喜欢宝拉，因为不喜欢小霸王的形象，以及动不动就打弟弟妹妹，所有人言听计从的大姐大形象，但是和后来恋爱中的女人形成了反差萌。</p>
<p>德善一开始也觉得她太夸张了，尤其是对于善宇，不过后来发现了她的善解人意的一面，长大之后造型好看10倍之后，对阿泽的各种无微不至的关怀，还有对人情的心照不宣，让她能在男生圈子和女生圈子都混得很开。这个看上去疯疯癫癫的丫头实际上情商特别高。</p>
<p>善宇是个挺理想的男生，他对宝拉会有占有欲，这一点一直体现到他给宝拉提三个条件的时候。不过结婚这个感觉是凑大结局需要，因为各种意义上说结婚还是有点突兀的。对这种懂事听话颜值海星的角色好感都不是特别低。</p>
<p>前半对阿泽除了会下棋没有别的印象（大概率是和善宇搞混了）在围棋职业生涯中却压力重重，回到了双门洞就是一个再普通不过的纯情男孩，最后如其所愿地收获了喜欢的女孩，一开始也奇怪是不是看走眼了，不过看德善长大之后的真的觉得阿泽擅长投资潜力股，无论再性格还是在颜值都是破天荒。</p>
<p>正焕在这部剧的造型不是我的type，说话也是真的狗，就这种做法，得不到德善也是理所当然的。但是他的各种小心翼翼也算是情商高的体现了。尤其是最后表白完心意之后那个开玩笑一般的表现，让在场所有人都不至于过于尴尬。而且看上去吊儿郎当的人最后去当了军官也是有点意外。</p>
<p>其他家长基本就不过多评价了，不过家长里短里面，看似闲言闲语的家庭主妇之间在长时间的唠嗑也收获了姐妹真情。正焕的哥哥居然也捡到宝了（可怜正焕），看上去不靠谱的东龙做生意也有声有色，德善弟弟也算半个潜力股。各种意义算是比较圆满的HE。人物特色也很鲜明，是一部值得看的电视剧。</p>

    <title>金融的逻辑</title>
    <url>/200315-Logic-of-Finance/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<h1 id="金融"><a href="#金融" class="headerlink" title="金融"></a>金融</h1><p>陈志武的《金融的逻辑》是找《市场的逻辑》这本书的时候顺便找到的。其中很多理论让我觉得很在理，比如说“养儿防老”和所谓的礼尚往来其实都是隐形的金融产品，等到我们的社会金融产业发达之后，这些不一定可靠的金融产品会被取代，到时候人们才是会真正注重情感的交流</p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dori-min/dori-min-pics/master/img/20200315123431.png" alt=""></p>
<h1 id="价值、资本、金钱、财富"><a href="#价值、资本、金钱、财富" class="headerlink" title="价值、资本、金钱、财富"></a>价值、资本、金钱、财富</h1><p>也就是，只有相对于人的效用而言，才有价值这回事。</p>
<p>价值由未来的收益而定，不是由过去的成本决定。</p>
<p>有一点是肯定的，不管是古代，还是现代，单个人生存下去的能力是很低的，天灾人祸、身老病残时你都需要其他人的帮助。所以，为了能够更顺利地活下去，也为了生命的延续，个人必须跟其他人进行跨时间、跨空间的利益交换，即，人与人之间的金融交易是人类活下去的必须。</p>
<p>金融交易一般不是现货交易，而是价值的跨期支付，不能是一锤子买卖，所以，没有互信、没有保证金融契约执行的制度基础，就没有金融交易的发展。</p>
<p>都过多受利益驱使，使利益和感情无法分离。其结果只能是淡化家庭的情感功能，侵蚀亲情间的情感氛围。</p>
<p>一个人可以因为“不孝”而处死，等于说人存在的唯一价值就是金融交易的载体，就是他的金融工具作用，就是体现“养子防老”，不承认超越金融交易载体的人权。</p>
<p>什么是钱？资本？财富？<br>“钱”主要是一个货币的概念</p>
<p>资本也是活的价值，尽管其“活”性较钱低，但它是能够生产价值的价值</p>
<p>财富既包括流动性的，也包括不流动的价值，即死的有价物，一般的财富并不一定能产生财富</p>
<p>从契约理论的角度讲，财富往往是物、是“东西”，货币是把“东西”卖掉之后的价值载体，而资本更多是“东西” 的“产权证”，它是广义的货币，是与具体的“东西”相对应的产权。</p>
<p>股市这种未来收入折现机器</p>
<p>贷款的质押物是房屋，但真正用来做支付保障的不是房屋，而是买主的未来工资收入，所以，住房按揭贷款体现的主要是买主未来劳动收入的资本价值，</p>
<h1 id="中国的资本化"><a href="#中国的资本化" class="headerlink" title="中国的资本化"></a>中国的资本化</h1><p>如果简单点讲，是由于“改革开放”，但从更深的层面，我们可以从“钱化”和“资本化”的角度来理解中国这些年的经历。</p>
<p>第一阶段是从1978至1990年代中期，其核心是给老百姓买卖东西的自由，他们有选择生产什么、到哪里卖、如何卖的自由，包括劳动力市场与创业市场上的自由，</p>
<p>1990年代中期开始，特别是1998年之后的阶段，可以概括为“资本化”时期，就是让企业资产（包括有形资产和未来收入流）、土地和各类自然资源、劳动者未来收入流，都可通过产权化、证券化或者金融票据化转变成流通的金融资本</p>
<p>第二阶段改革的直接效果是将以下四大类“财富”转换成“资本”，使中国的金融资本大增。第一是土地和自然资源，第二是企业财产和未来收入流，第三是社会个人和家庭的未来劳动收入，第四是政府未来财政收入。</p>
<h1 id="资本化"><a href="#资本化" class="headerlink" title="资本化"></a>资本化</h1><p>为了使中国更有“钱”，土地和国有企业都应该私有，为进一步资本化开路。</p>
<p>在原来由亲情、友情实现的互助互惠式隐性金融交易被钱化之后，而如果替代性的显性金融保险、信贷、养老、投资产品又无法跟上，中国人在钱多的同时，可能反而对未来更感到不安，不仅使中国的内需无法增长，使中国经济增长继续依赖出口，也让中国人的幸福感下降。</p>
<p>在传统中国社会里，血缘是这些族内、亲情内部利益交换的信用基础，而儒家“三纲五常”名分等级秩序便是信用交易的具体文化制度保障。“孝”道文化是这种个人未来生活安全保障体系的另称。</p>
<p>“养子防老”，亲戚间“礼尚往来”，生老病死时的相互帮助，这些都是保险、养老、信贷、投资等的具体实现形式，</p>
<p>随着中国社会结构的转型、文化价值观的变化，原来靠血缘、亲情实现的隐性金融交易正在由金融市场以显性金融交易的形式取而代之。</p>
<p>原因有几个方面：第一，人口流动大大增加</p>
<p>由血缘、家族提供的经济保障和养老互助功能越来越不可靠，正式的金融交易产品必须取而代之</p>
<p>第二，多年来所执行的独生子女政策也使单纯的家庭、家族养老互助体系无法胜任，效果越来越低</p>
<p>第三，在文化价值观上，中国人越来越追求个人自由和经济独立，把未来的生活保障尽量掌握在自己的手里</p>
<p>朋友之间有一个隐性的共识或默契，那就是在这次来帮忙的朋友下次也要搬家或者也要外出有行李时，张三必须也能随叫随到。</p>
<p>而是友情，但实际上都是隐性的跨时间利益交换，具备投资、保险或信贷的经济功能</p>
<p>“在外靠朋友”原来是市场不发达的结果！</p>
<p>因为这类收入和投资原来就有，只是没有被“钱化”而已，是隐性的。今天在市场化发展深化之后，这些经济活动被市场取代了，同样的经济交易被显性化了。这就是为什么许多人在钱包鼓起来的同时，却并不一定感到更富有，原因在于市场化发展后“什么都要钱了”。</p>
<p>当这些经济活动被逐步市场化、“钱化”之后，人们在家族、朋友网内的这些投入会越来越少，亲情和友情更多的会以感情交流为主，而不是以经济利益交易为核心</p>
<p>这就好像在“打倒孔家店”后，如果金融市场的发展程度又没跟上，人们要么会惶惶不安，要么会重建“孔家店”。</p>
<p>中国的金融发展水平总体还很低，投资和理财的选择空间很小，只有少数有限的投资渠道。这两方面挤在一起，特别是在政府高度管制金融和国有金融垄断的情况下，各种资产价格扭曲和畸形资产泡沫层出不穷，就不奇怪了。</p>
<h1 id="沈南鹏"><a href="#沈南鹏" class="headerlink" title="沈南鹏"></a>沈南鹏</h1><p>1999年他创办携程，2003年在纳斯达克上市</p>
<p>沈南鹏继而于2004年投资分众传媒、创建如家快捷连锁酒店等企业，其中，分众于2005年成功上市，如家快捷正在上市申请过程中</p>
<p>他辞去携程的总裁和首席财务官职位，创办美国私人股权基金——红杉（Sequoia）在中国的分公司</p>
<p>作为一种金属，白银本身没有太多的工业价值。但正因为许多国家在不同时期用白银作为货币，所以它就特别值“钱”。而之所以白银被用作“钱”，就是因为没有发展出支持票券信用的制度。换言之，只要有了便于金融票券交易的制度，金银作为“钱”的价值就没有了。</p>
<p>所以，制度的优劣决定一个国家“钱”的多寡。</p>
<h1 id="国家负债水平的政治体现"><a href="#国家负债水平的政治体现" class="headerlink" title="国家负债水平的政治体现"></a>国家负债水平的政治体现</h1><p>一国的民主法治似乎跟其政府负债水平高度相关</p>
<p>当时，十三个州的政府本身就很小，没什么税收，没有政府军队，更没有州政府财产或者“国有企业”。美国中央政府又不存在，是真正的白手起家。所以，各届大陆会议只能靠印纸币、借债，来找到财务支持。这就是为什么美国从立国之初，就要靠金融和债务市场！</p>
<p>具体来说，独立战争开支主要依靠以下来源，第一是由政府发行“大陆币”</p>
<p>第二，由大陆会议政府发行债券，尽管谁都不知道那些债务将来靠什么偿还</p>
<p>第三，十三州的份子贡献，由各州自己发行战争债提供；第四，从法国借来的贷款；再就是给士兵、供货商写欠条。</p>
<h2 id="时代更迭"><a href="#时代更迭" class="headerlink" title="时代更迭"></a>时代更迭</h2><p>所以那种靠百姓武装革命达到改朝换代的时代已经结束</p>
<p>正规军与老百姓间的武器不对称已达到极点</p>
<h2 id="外债与稳定"><a href="#外债与稳定" class="headerlink" title="外债与稳定"></a>外债与稳定</h2><p>1990年代的亚洲国家、1930-40年代的民国中国以及过去20年里的拉美国家却因国债、外债而频繁出现危机和社会动乱，这是为什么呢？</p>
<p>答案还在制度资本上，在对权力的制约以及政府预算过程是否透明上</p>
<h1 id="中国文化与经济发展"><a href="#中国文化与经济发展" class="headerlink" title="中国文化与经济发展"></a>中国文化与经济发展</h1><p>除了要满足今天的物质消费和精神需求外，一个人面对的更重要的挑战是对未来生活的担忧，包括未来物质生活所需的收入的不确定性、身体健康的不确定性，</p>
<p>第二，或许有没有以宗教或者理性学术支撑的精神文明不重要，更重要的是我们把生活重点放在精神追求上，而不是过分追求物质生活。中国人追求的精神生活或许不是宗教性的，而是家庭温暖和亲情。</p>
<p>第三，中国文化的核心重点在于维护“家”的经济功能，轻视其社交与情感功能，这必然抑制中国文化的精神文明内涵。</p>
<p>“五四”运动给中国带来了自由、民主、法治思想。回过头再看，当时的思想先驱至少在两方面存在盲点，其一是私有产权，其二是发展金融与保险市场，这二者是实现自由、民主、法治的经济基础。</p>
<p>一些学者认为中国文化重视家庭，而西方文化则不然。——这显然是一种误解，实际上中国人和西方人都重视“家”，只是追求的“家”的境界不同。传统中国的“家”侧重强制性的经济交易功能，西方社会的“家”侧重基于自愿的感情交往功能。</p>
<p>儒家学者说，中华文化比西方文化更侧重精神生活的境界。——这种结论很难站住</p>
<p>中国传统学问存在根本性的“实证”盲点，让文人把中国过去一百多年的遭遇跟中国文化脱离开来，认为那些落后挨打不是传统中华文化所致，而是由外国人所致</p>
<p>今天的情况跟那时期正好相反，中国经济今天正在崛起，这时我们只愿意把成功归功于自己，归结于中华文化，跟世界整体发展无关</p>
<p>按照我们熟悉的政治经济学，只有劳动才创造价值。我们中国人的传统观念也如此，总觉得只有生产那些看得见摸得着的东西、制造实物，那才是真正在做事，在真正创造价值。</p>
<p>比如，中国家庭里，老子说话时，孩子不可以还嘴。你从小就得养成这个习惯，每个父母亲在孩子出生之后就有责任给他们灌输这个概念：你要孝敬，要听话，哪怕这话是不合理的，你也只能听，不能还嘴。否则的话，等你长大之后你不是要无法无天、要随意犯上了吗？</p>

    <title>孤独六讲摘抄</title>
    <url>/191230-six-lectures-on-loneliness/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p><em>前言：蒋勋的这本书颇为有趣，在不同时候看有不同的体会，一个人吃饭的时候，看着社会新闻的时候，吃着狗粮的时候，思考的时候。</em></p>
<hr>
<h1 id="情欲孤獨"><a href="#情欲孤獨" class="headerlink" title="情欲孤獨"></a>情欲孤獨</h1><p>家庭、伦理的束缚之巨大，远超于我们的想像。包括我自己，尽管说得冠冕堂皇，只要在八十四岁的妈妈面前，我又变回了小孩子，哪敢谈什么自我？谈什么情欲孤独？她照样站在门口和邻居聊我小时候尿床的糗事，讲得我无地自容，她只是若无其事地说：“这有什么不能说的？”</p>
<p>其实，我母亲和许多母亲一样，手上一直握有一把剪刀，专门剪孩子的头发，比中学时代教官手中那一把更厉害，这一把看不见的剪刀叫做“爱”或是“关心”。因为这把剪刀，母亲成为我走向孤独的最后一道关卡。</p>
<p>在我们的文化中，以“爱”、“关心”或是“孝”之名，其所做的任何决定都是对的，不允许相对的讨论、怀疑──而没有怀疑就无法萌生孤独感，因为孤独感就是生命对生命本身采取怀疑的态度。</p>
<p>這是一個非常典型的儒家思想，沒有人敢特立獨行，大家都遵守著「中庸之道」，不做第一，也不做最後。儒家思想歌頌的是一種群體文化，我要特別申明的是，並不是認為歌頌群體的文化不好，事實上儒家思想是以農業為基礎，一定和群體有關。所謂的群體是指大家要共同遵守一些規則，社群才能有其生存的條件，特別是在窮困的農業社會中。而特立獨行是在破壞群體，就會受到群體的譴責。</p>
<p>死亡是生命本质的孤独，无法克服的宿命。法国存在主义哲学家沙特说过，人从出生那一刻起，就开始走向死亡。</p>
<h1 id="語言孤獨"><a href="#語言孤獨" class="headerlink" title="語言孤獨"></a>語言孤獨</h1><p>人類的語言文字可以有兩種種極端的發展，一段是發展成為「詩」，一端就是發為法律條文。</p>
<p>當我們以儒家為正統的文化主流時，語言必然會走向詩，而不是走向法律條文。</p>
<p>一直以来，我觉得很矛盾，到底语言应该是像希腊语、像法语一样的精准，或者在潜意识里我其实是得到一种颠覆准确语言的快乐，因为我感觉到准确的语言本身是一种吊诡，我们用各种方法使语言愈来愈准确，当语言愈来愈准确，几乎是没有第二种模棱两可的含义时，语言就丧失了应有的弹性，语言作为一个传达意思、心事的工具，就会受到很大的局限。再者，写小说、文学作品，本来就在颠覆语言的各种可能性，你觉得“应该是这个样子”就偏不是“那个样子”。</p>
<p>我們都應該讓自己有機會從概念的語言逃開，檢查自己的語言，「問渠哪得清如許，為有源頭活水來」，使語言保持在「活水」的狀態，語言便不會僵死。</p>
<p>於是有了禪宗，一個不相信語言的教派，他認為所有的語言都是誤會，所有的語言都會使修行者走向一個更荒謬、背叛修行的道路，所以最後不用語言也不用文字，把佛法大義變成一則一則的公案，以簡單、易懂的白話弘揚佛法。</p>
<h1 id="革命孤獨"><a href="#革命孤獨" class="headerlink" title="革命孤獨"></a>革命孤獨</h1><p>「如果你二十五歲時不是共產黨員，你一輩子不會有希望；如果你二十五歲以後還是共產黨員，你這一輩子也不會有什麼希望。」原來他說的「共產黨」就是革命，講的是一個夢想，當你二十五歲時有過一個激昂的夢想，一生不會太離譜，因為那是一個烏托邦式的寄託；可是二十五歲以後，你應該務實了，卻還在相信遙遠的夢想，大概人生就沒什麼希望了。</p>
<p>沒錯，就是夢想。革命者自己營造出來的烏托邦國度，多半是現世裡無法完成的夢想，總是會受到世俗之人所嘲笑，因此他是孤獨的。</p>
<p>因此再思考「什麼是革命孤獨？」的問題時，我會把革命者視為一個懷抱夢想，而夢想在現世裡無法完成的人。夢想越是無法完成，越具備詩的美學性，如果在現世裡夢想就能實現，那麼革命就會變成體制、變成其他的改革，而不再是革命。</p>
<p>【一旦革命成功，便不可能再是詩】</p>
<p>但是，革命者若不是最後畫下一個漂亮的句點，其實蠻難堪的。這是我一直想講的矛盾，革命者的孤獨應該有一個死去的自我，可是革命不就是為了要成功嗎？為什麼所有的革命者都是以失敗者的角色在歷史上留名？</p>
<p>革命者本身包合著夢想的完成，但是在現實中，一旦革命成功，夢想不能再是夢想，必須落實在制度的改革，以及瑣瑣碎碎大大小小的行政事務上，它便不可能再是詩</p>
<p>我真的覺得革命並不理性，是一種激情。而古今中外的革命者，都是詩人，他們用血淚寫詩，他們用生命寫詩，他們所留下的不只是文字語言的美好，更多是生命華貴的形式。</p>
<p>而對台灣的學運，我總有一種矛盾的情緒，既高興它很快的成功了，又難過學運成功得太快，人性裡最高貴的情操不足歷練，人性的豐富性也來不及被提高，是一種悵然若失的感覺吧！</p>
<h1 id="暴力孤獨"><a href="#暴力孤獨" class="headerlink" title="暴力孤獨"></a>暴力孤獨</h1><p>所以存在主義說，存在先於本質，不應該先對人的本質下定論之後，再去搜羅存在的狀態，存在的本身應該是觀察的起點，即使荒謬，都應該去觀察，而不能將其排斥除外。</p>
<p>人性本來就有荒謬性，人性荒謬現實的兩極性描寫，大概是訓練自己觀察事物的方法。你可以試試看，在一個事件發生時，你會不會和大家一起眾口紛紜地去發言？例如新聞報導某甲涉嫌性騷擾，有許多人指著電視就說：「你看，我早就知道，他長的就是這個樣子。」</p>
<p>如果你可以細心地去觀察，會發現很多暴力是來自社會大眾的「眾口鑠金」，這句成語是說，當每一張嘴巴都講同樣一句話，其力量足以把金子鎔化，力量如此之大！而我們每一個人都可能曾經參與其中。</p>
<p>我們經常用不同的暴力形式待人，打罵是最容易發現的暴力，但有時候我們對人的嘲諷是暴力、對人的冷漠是暴力，有時候……母親對孩子的愛也是暴力；你可以看張愛玲的一部小說《金鎖記》，看那個母親對她最愛的孩子長白所做的事，真是聳動，為了不讓兒子出去玩女人或是做別的她不喜歡的事，她教他抽鴉片，讓他留在身邊。她覺得這是愛，如果你告訴她，這是暴力，她一定哭倒在地，她會說她這麼愛孩子，還準備把所有的遺產都給他。</p>
<p>暴力是很難檢查的，因為暴力的形式會偽裝成另一種情感，我故意用這個例子，因為愛和暴力是兩種極端，卻可能同時出現，唯有認知到這一點，暴力美學才有可能觸碰到更根本的問題。</p>
<p>我在這本書所談的六種孤獨，其實是互相關聯，我們可以進一步思考，革命者悲天憫人的革命思想，會不會也成為一種暴力？例如我提出一個假說：「走向革命場域的男女，有一部分是在滿足自己暴力殘酷之感」，你是否會同意？就像卡繆的《正義之士》裡要探討的，那個謀刺的人在炸死暴君的那一剎那所思考的問題：「我究竟是暴力還是革命？」此時他的思辨變得複雜，而有更多機會去檢視行為的狀態。</p>
<p>人性對「惡」有更充足的瞭解，才能有「善」的發揚，所以我一直覺得很遺憾，荀子的性惡論沒有繼續發展，使得孟子的性善論就像小說裡的大學生，變得不切實際。我們一定要知道，性善論和性惡論單獨存在時都沒有意義，必須讓兩者互動，引導到思辨、思維，才能對人性有最更深層、更高層次的探討。</p>
<h1 id="思維孤獨"><a href="#思維孤獨" class="headerlink" title="思維孤獨"></a>思維孤獨</h1><p>在解嚴之後，我發現台灣有好多機會可以產生思辨。當一個社會裡面，出現很多不同且極端的意見和看法時，就是思辨產生的時機。例如蘭嶼設立核能廢料儲存場，兩種結論性的答案：對或者不對，是兩個極端，中間才是思辨的空間。又例如統獨的問題，是台灣最值得思辨的一個問題，可是直到現在，很少看到兩個人好好坐下來，說他為什麼贊成統一，或為什麼贊成獨立。我們很少與人進行思辨，只是急著發表結論，當對方的結論和自己不一樣時，就是舉拳頭決定了。</p>
<p>因為缺乏溝通的耐心，思辨的過程完全被簡化了。</p>
<hr>
<p>這裡面可以有許多非常有趣的思考。因為你沒辦法求得標準答案，你也許會覺得好荒謬，可是你究竟要如何面對這件事？為什麼會有人捐贈器官被拒絕？而拒絕的人是寧死不從，像文天祥一樣慷慨激昂地說：「我不要他的心臟。」當時看到這則新聞，我又想哭又想笑，覺得生命真是既悲涼又荒謬。</p>
<p>存在主義非常喜歡談「荒謬」這個字，處於生命荒謬的情境中，就是人們思辨的時機。因為荒謬本身代表著不合理，所以你可以開始思考為什麼產生荒謬感？荒謬感從何而來？如何處置這個荒謬感？思辨於焉開始了。</p>
<hr>
<p>同樣地，我也一直期待一個政治哲學家，期待他能喚醒民眾。孫中山臨終前，諄諄告誡說要「喚起民眾」，因為他受西方啟蒙訓練，他是一個哲學家，不是政客。他不是要告訴民眾對不對、好不好，他要喚醒民眾的思維，他知道若是民眾無法思考，社會的繁榮強大都是假的，都將毀於一旦。</p>
<p>可惜直到目前為止，政治人物的選舉，不但不能喚醒思維，還使所有的思維崩潰。</p>
<p>解嚴這麼久了，人們關注的焦點，還是只在於他是哪一個政黨或誰應該下台、誰應該道歉。不只是政治人物，包括媒體，媒體常常暴力到不讓人去思考事件過程，就直接下了一個結論。是不是真如我哲學系同學突然講出的那一句荒謬的話：「台灣沒有哲學」，或者，台灣思維的可能沒有完全絕望，只是等待機會被啟發？</p>
<hr>
<p>哲學是面對現象的思考。如果你讀很多莊子的寓言故事，卻不能分析你當前的現象，我不覺得這是哲學。希臘所謂的philosophy，哲學，是「愛智」的意思。熱愛智慧、熱愛思辨叫作哲學，如果你只是讀別人講過的東西，本身沒有思辨，只是繼承或模仿別人的想法，就不能稱之為哲學。</p>
<p>因為，哲學的起點是懷疑。</p>
<hr>
<p>【最大的孤獨】</p>
<p>當百分之九十九點九的人說暴力是不好的，剩餘的百分之零點一才說了：「暴力……」大家已經開始罵他了：「你沒有人性，怎麼會贊成暴力？」他可能不是選擇贊成或反對，而是選擇思考。</p>
<p>所以，我認為思維孤獨，是六種孤獨裡面最大的孤獨。作為一個不思考的社會裡的一個思考者，他的心靈是最寂寞、最孤獨的。因為他必須要先能夠忍受，他所發出來的語言，可能是別人聽不懂的、無法接受的，甚至是別人立刻要去指責的。作為一個孤獨者，他能不能堅持著自己的思維性？是很大的考驗。</p>
<hr>
<p>莊子說：「人生也有涯，知也無涯。」人活著，他的生命是有限的，可是他的知識是無限的，意思是說你怎麼學都學不完，你必須不斷地航向未知的世界。</p>
<p>可是大部分的人半路就停下來了，不肯走了。唯有真正的思維者堅持著孤獨，一直走下去。最後，那個孤獨的人，走在最前面的人，他所能達到的領域當然是人類的最前端。</p>
<p>所以，思維的孤獨性恐怕是所有的孤獨裡面最巨大的一個。</p>
<p>任何一個社會皆是如此。當你坐著思考一個問題的時候，絕對保有一個巨大的自我的孤獨性。</p>
<h1 id="倫理孤獨"><a href="#倫理孤獨" class="headerlink" title="倫理孤獨"></a>倫理孤獨</h1><p>道德對人類的行為，預設了一個範圍，範圍內屬於倫理，範圍外的就是亂倫。而在轉換的過程中，所有的倫理分類都要重新調整。我相信，人類今天也在面對一個巨大倫理重新調整的時代。舉例而言，過去的君臣倫理已經被顛覆了，但是在轉換的過程，我們還是存在一種意識形態：要忠於領袖人物。這個倫理在我父親那一輩身上很明顯，在我看來則是「愚忠」，可是我無法和父親討論這件事，一提到他就會翻臉，忠君愛國的倫理就是他的中心思想，不能夠背叛。在古代，君臣倫理更是第一倫理，「君要臣死，臣不能不死」，不論合理不合理。如果從君臣倫理的角度來看，我們都亂倫了，我們都背叛了君臣之倫。</p>
<p>五倫之中，最難以撼動的是父子倫，也就是親子之間的倫理。儒家文化說「百善孝為先，萬惡淫為首」，意思是在所有的善行中，第一個要做的就是孝；而所有的罪惡中以情慾最嚴重。所以漢代時有察舉孝廉制度，鄉里間會薦舉孝子為官，認為凡是孝順的人，就一定能當個好官。但是我們看東漢的政治，並沒有因為察舉制度改革官僚體制，反而有更多懦弱、偽善的官員出現。連帶地，孝也變成偽善，是可以表演給別人看的。</p>
<hr>
<p>在日本，離婚率最高的年齡層是在中年以後，就是孩子長大離家後，做妻子的覺得該盡的責任已經盡了，便提出離婚，說：「我再也不要忍受了」，往往會把丈夫嚇一大跳。這樣的報導愈來愈多，不像我們所想像的年輕夫妻才會離婚。</p>
<p>有人說，這是因為婚姻有很大一部分是為了倫理的完成，當倫理完成以後，她就可以去追尋自我了。但我覺得應該是在充分地完成自我之後，再去建構倫理，倫理會更完整。</p>
<hr>
<p>我相信，倫理本身是有彈性的，如何堅持倫理，又能保持倫理在遞變過程中的彈性，是我認為的兩難。大概對於倫理的思維，還是要回到絕對的個體，回到百分之零點零一的個體，當個體完成了，倫理才有可能架構起來。</p>
<hr>
<p>倫理構成中私的部分，「父為子隱，子為父隱」的這個部分，造成了許許多多的問題被掩蓋了。例如家庭性暴力，有時候女兒被父親性侵害，母親明明知道，卻不講的，她覺得這是「家醜」，而家醜是不能外揚的。她沒有孩子是獨立個體、是公民的概念，所以會去掩蓋事實，構成了倫理徇私的狀況。</p>
<hr>
<p>我們不太敢承認，可是倫理有時候的確是非常大的暴力。我們覺得倫理是愛，但就像我在暴力孤獨裡丟出來的問題：母愛有沒有可能是暴力？如果老師出一個作文題目「母愛」，沒有一個人會寫「這是一種暴力」，可是如果有百分之零點一的人寫出「母愛是暴力」時，這個問題就值得我們重視。</p>
<hr>
<p>你渴望大團圓嗎？還是渴望揭發一些看起來不舒服的東西。</p>
<p>儒家的大團圓往往是讓「不舒服的東西」假裝不存在。就像過年時不講「死」字，或是公寓大樓沒有四樓；死亡是倫理這麼大的命題，不可能不存在，我們卻用「假裝」去迴避。當孔子說：「未知生，焉知死」，或者我們平常不說「四」而說「三加一」時，就是在迴避死亡，這時候倫理有可能揭發出一些真相嗎？我們要粉飾太平地只看大團圓的結局？還是要忍住眼淚，忍住悲痛，去看一些真相？這也是一個兩難。</p>
<p>即使我們與最親密的人擁抱在一起，我們還是孤獨的，在那一剎那就讓我們認識到倫理的本質就是孤獨，因為再綿密的人際網絡，也無法將人與人合為一體，就像柏拉圖說的，人注定要被劈開，去尋找另一半，而且總是找錯。大團圓的文化是讓我們偶爾陶醉一下，以為自己找到了另一半，可是只要你清醒了，你就知道個體的孤獨性不可能被他者替代了。但不要誤會這就沒有愛了，而是在個體更獨立的狀態下，他的愛才會更成熟，不會是陶醉，也不會是倚賴。成熟的愛是倚靠不是倚賴，倚靠是在你偶爾疲倦的時候可以靠一下休息一下，倚賴則是賴著不走了。</p>
<p>我們常常把倫理當作倚賴，子女對父母、父母對子女都是。我在大陸看到一胎化的子女，受到父母、爺爺奶奶、外公外婆的寵愛，有人覺得這樣很幸福，我卻覺得很可怕，因為當孩子長大後，這些人會反過來倚賴他，那是多麼沉重啊！</p>
<p>當我們可以從健全的個體出發，倚靠不會變成倚賴，倚靠也不會變成一種常態，因為自己是可以獨立的，不管對父母、對子女、對情人、對朋友，會產生一種遇到知己的喜悅，而不是盲目的沉醉，如此一來，所建構出來的倫理也會是更健全的。</p>
<hr>
<p>【打開自己的抽屜】</p>
<p>倫理孤獨是當前社會最難走過的一環，也最不容易察覺，一方面是倫理本身有一個最大的掩護──愛，因為愛是無法對抗的，我們可以對抗恨，很難去對抗愛。然而，個體孤獨的健全就是要對抗不恰當的愛，將不恰當的愛做理性的分類紓解，才有可能保有孤獨的空間。</p>
<p>孤獨空間不只是實質的空間，還包括心靈上的空間，即使是面對最親最親的人，都應該保有自己孤獨的隱私，要保有自己的心事，即使是夫妻，即使是父母與子女，就像在〈因為孤獨的緣故〉裡，中年婦女「我」因為兒子詩承沒有告訴她自己認識了一名警察，而且彼此有過一段愉快的相處，而感到不舒服。可是對兒子而言，這是他生命中重要且美好的部分，他可以把這件事放在心靈的抽屜裡，不一定要打開它。</p>
<hr>
<p>我相信，一個真正完整快樂的人，不需要藉助別人的隱私來使自己豐富，他自己就能讓生命豐富起來。</p>
<hr>
<p>沒有思維的倫理很容易變成墮落，因為太習以為常。例如想到婆媳關係，就聯想到哭哭啼啼的畫面，可是現代人的婆媳關係是可以有更多面向的。如果你覺得在一個傳統固定的倫理裡待太久了，思想會不自覺地受到傳統倫理的制約</p>

    <title>巫师财经</title>
    <url>/191212-wizard-finance/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>昨天拖延症犯了，放下了手里的事情，在b站看了好多视频。总结一下看到的东西。</p>
<p>首先是补完了<strong>巫师财经</strong>的视频。对于我一个金融小白的确是很重要的科普。</p>
<p>主要是四个部分吧，第一个是我在油管看过的，关于金融行业收入和鄙视链的问题，让我反思现在我自己身处行业是不是同样有【买家&gt;卖家&gt;中间商】的思想。身在中间的我背负着前人的希望，想要往上跳，但是我觉得始终不能乱了阵脚，动摇了自己原本的商业模式和资金。而且我也秉承着一种商业的“工匠”精神，还是想要维护自己原本的业务。</p>
<p>第二个部分是几个讲明星和资本的故事，主要有杨超越、蔡徐坤和杨幂。其中前两者还在进行中，而杨幂则是一个超额完成对赌协议、从资产晋升资本的典型成功案例。这不禁让我想到了今年被收购的自家偶像，看着这不温不火的样子估计背后是没有大资本的对赌在其中，但是那句话，【铁打的资本，流水的偶像】，没有了资本的支持，48G走向衰落不是一天两天，那么作为一个偶像宅，我想要看到的是什么，偶像和偶像宅的未来是什么，这发人深思。</p>
<p>第三个部分是讲几个资本博弈的故事，爱马仕vsLV，奔驰vs保时捷，不同的命运，不同的结果，这些品牌在资本的面前只不过是玩具。</p>
<p>第四个是一个讲香港股市攻防战的故事。国际空军搞垮英格兰和东南亚之后瞄准了香港，而股市最后依靠政府才勉强撑过了这次攻击。</p>
<p>总的来说学到的东西还是用巫师的一句话概括——【资本永不眠】</p>
<hr>
<p>然后还补完了【干货gin酱】的最终幻想解说。其实我一直很喜欢最终幻想这背后的神话色彩和科技色彩的背景。</p>
<p>最终幻想13的角色我至今都还记得，给当时的我留下了非常深刻的音响，直到现在这款游戏在我心中还属于上乘地位，女主雷霆（雷光）、型男雪诺、正太霍普，虽然对这些角色充满好感，但是对剧情一无所知，只隐隐约约记得茧、路西等等名词。</p>

    <title>How we go on</title>
    <url>/191112-how-we-go-on/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>又名<strong>清水湾之殇</strong>。</p>
<hr>
<p>最近的事情本来应该不对我的正常生活造成影响，但是五天的“小长假”的的确确让我感受到了波及。</p>
<p>首先关于所谓的正义和真相，我选择避而不谈。首先这种非物质的概念，我觉得是没有准确定义的。正在huma堂死磕以justice为主题的essay的我，在挣扎中也似乎感受到了一点prof的用心。而所谓真相，我觉得在这个媒体世界里是可遇不可求的东西，我曾经相信过一定会存在，但是马红事件又让我感慨颇深，有所改观，所以我更愿意相信<strong>“所有的真相都有立场”</strong>的观点。就像芥川龙之介的笔下一样，面对一个有政治色彩的事件，不同角度的人难以有所谓客观。就算是处于事件之外的人，也不可能没有自己的立场，不可能有绝对的中立，<strong>一切都代表着利益</strong>。</p>
<p>这sem刚开学的时候，刚好在读《factfulness》，其中谈到了fear instinct。我颇以为然，并且认同社会状况是由这种普遍的fear instinct引起的。在十月之前我都抱有这样的态度。</p>
<p>但是我错了。</p>
<p>这不是单纯的fear instinct能够带来的结果。</p>
<p>这背后复杂的政治、经济、文化原因当然是占据主导地位的。我贫乏的历史知识告诉我，一切的根本都是经济原因。但是偏偏这里经济并不是能被简单地化解的问题，这一点的比喻可以参考韩国。</p>
<hr>
<p>对我所处环境的影响直接发生在事件之后。</p>
<p>虽然从开学以来每天晚上十点的口号已然是家常便饭，海报和文宣也倒是不看则罢。密尔说，捍卫言论自由，但是不得伤害他人。</p>
<p>在PKU听法学院饶戈平教授的讲座的时候，他对所谓言论自由的定义对于我而言也是可以接受的——言论自由不是绝对的自由，而是法律约束下的自由。</p>
<p>这点虽然在内地条件下没有能达到，但是在这个极端条件下更加没有实现的苗头，而且到了匪夷所思的地步，这是背道而驰的。</p>
<p>话说回来，我本来对我所处的学校是极其信任的，甚至说这也是我选择的重要原因之一——这里的人们醉心学习，这里的人们不问世事。</p>
<p>但是我又错了。</p>
<p>我忘记了这些人是通过同一个考试选拔出来的，无论又多么浓厚的学术氛围，很多事情是难以改变的，比如出身、背景、社会条件。再加上这次事件的特殊性，直接导致这个我喜爱的地方，成为了硝烟弥漫的战场。</p>
<p>在过去的事件，对于做出犹豫的人们来说，我一直极力劝他们加入这里，为了海景也好，学术氛围也好，科研水平也好，并且让他们相信这里会好，但是面对现在的情况，我只能报以惭愧的歉意。</p>
<p>就算如此，如果让我再来一次，我也许还是会来。人生是没有后悔药的。</p>
<p>我选择相信一切会好起来，起码在这个学校。</p>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>看到ibooks促销有川浩老师有几本书300日元一本，读了很多她的书想想应该不会踩雷就买了两本。</p>
<p>这本书分side A和B。主要都是讲的女主是作家，和上班族男主之间的故事。</p>
<p>不过side A是女主一开始自己偷偷摸摸写，被男主发现之后两人交往结婚，女主在男主的鼓励下投稿，得了大赏，女主遂辞职成为职业作家。</p>
<p>最后女主身患绝症不治身亡。</p>
<p>side B是女主本来就有出版书，机缘巧合被男主发现男主一直喜欢的作家是同事，然后结婚交往。男主说，写一部丈夫死掉的小说会很有趣，女主以为是开玩笑。最后男主因肿瘤身亡。</p>
<p>这里对于我来说有几个地方很注意，一个是side A女主得的病是那种思考得越多死得越快的病，最后女主留下了一封写满了喜欢的信之后死去。</p>
<p>用手机看书，滑到满页刷屏还怪吓人的。side A还有两次。</p>
<p>另外一个是side B。side B中间有很长一段好像讲的是女主的父亲的故事，但是我没有仔细看，因为当时我还是比较关心女主和男主的发展，所以可能理解不够透彻。</p>
<p>虽然没有《阪急电车》那么有趣，也算是不错的睡前读物吧。</p>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>昨天晚上一个下午+一个晚上读完了这个差不多三百页的书，感慨自己读书的速度原来可以这么快（毕竟story seller看了十天以上呢，不过只是在睡前看一看罢了，没有那么集中的时间）。</p>
<p>这本书很容易让人联想到《我想吃掉你的胰脏》，的确，电影版男主角都是北村匠海。</p>
<p>同样是女主罹患绝症，这里用的是“发光病”这种架空的病，个人猜想是作者一开始在构想了两个人一起在医院的屋顶天体观测的时候少年和发光的少女的这个场景。</p>
<p>男主也是误打误撞地遇到女主，然后帮她去实现她死前的愿望，但是这里不一样的是，《胰脏》里是两个人一起去实现，因为女主还偶尔可以上学去学校，可以一起出行，但是本作的女主就是真的出不了医院，所以男主自己跑去游乐场、去女仆咖啡厅打工等等情节读起来很有趣。</p>
<p>这里提到女仆咖啡厅的リコちゃんさん（第一反应BBQ ww）一开始以为只是个过场的角色，没想到还是出现挺多次的，感觉是一直对男主抱有好感的，但是男主心有所属所以每次都拒绝她，两个人唯一比较近的接触就是一起去蹦迪那次，但是男主还是不为所动。最后交代了她和别的男人在一起了，也算是有一个着落吧。</p>
<p>女主对男主从一开始很主动，到后来男主告白女主说对不起，再到后来女主说男主不要再来了。到后来男主深夜潜入被看护士抓到，看护士告诉了他其实女主会梦里念他、想念到流泪，这才算重归于好。</p>
<p>不过重归于好不久，十四天，女主就去世了。</p>
<p>所以在女主想要实现的愿望的最后一个里，是希望男主幸福地活下去。</p>
<hr>
<p>这里还要提一下全作另外一个关键人物——香山。</p>
<p>香山有两个身份，一个是男主的恩人，因为男主在中学被欺凌的时候，香山去帮助他，结果从二楼掉下去，本来是篮球队的有潜力的队员，却再也不能发挥运动天赋了。</p>
<p>另外一个身份，香山是男主死去的姐姐的恋人。这里就是故事的另外一条线。男主的姐姐在高一的时候被车撞死，她的恋人也死于车祸，这件事就为这两个人蒙上了一层悲伤的忧郁色彩。男主的母亲一直很怕再失去男主，做什么都提心吊胆，家里也只做姐姐喜欢吃的。香山也思考过人的生死，曾经为女主恸哭过：“为什么那么美丽的人要死去，而像我一样的混蛋要活下来”。</p>
<p>香山是渣男，撩了年轻的班主任之后又只是玩玩，可是班主任却认真了。所以男主曾经讨厌过他，可是因为“恩人”的关系，所以又最后和他站在一起。</p>
<p>香山在小升初考试中带着重病考试，遇到女主，一见钟情，到小说的后半段和女主表白，可是女主说自己有喜欢的人，那个时候男主已经表白失败，但是香山一直知道女主其实是喜欢男主的。</p>
<p>男主在姐姐读的小说了发现了用红线画起来的一句话“如果爱人死去，那么就要一起去死”，这句话也贯穿了小说的后半部。看到女主一天天虚弱，男主也萌生了和姐姐一样的想法——但是最后男主还是活了下去，也是为了女主。</p>
<hr>
<p>还有一条线是女主的家庭，女主的爸爸原来是经营公司的，但是女主生病之后破产了，为了支付高额的医药费，爸爸决心离婚，让自己背负债务，也不去见女主。女主拜托男主去找他，在几次感化之后，在女主最后的日子里，爸爸终于放下了债务的压力去见了女主，最后女主快不行的时候，还是爸爸打电话给的男主。</p>
<hr>
<p>情节部分大概梳理到这里。</p>
<p>如果一定要和《胰脏》对比的话，其实我是更喜欢本作的叙述方式。本作的男主形象更加饱满，还有香山、リコちゃん、班主任等等这几个栩栩如生的人物，增强了代入感，而且很多情节和描写都很有趣；男主的思考倾向也很明显，从没有什么特别的想法，到想要去殉情，这种转变，是很多层因素共同促成的；</p>
<p>而《胰脏》更主要是男主、女主和女主基友这三个人，而男主的角色感其实并不是很强，因为没有怎么交代男主的背景，唯一有印象的特点就是爱读书，基本上全篇都是对女主的描写。</p>
<p>但是我还是更喜欢《胰脏》呈现出来的场景，或者说是真人电影版呈现出来的场景——樱花，桥，文库本。共病文库贯穿《胰脏》始终，而本作如果能有这样一个线索也许会更得我心。而且《胰脏》的暧昧的表白方式感觉更有韵味吧。</p>
<p>有时间吧这部的电影也补一下好了。</p>

    <content><![CDATA[<h1 id="P1"><a href="#P1" class="headerlink" title="P1"></a>P1</h1><p>I… remember._</p>
<p><em>That she had come around.</em></p>
<p><em>That sitting there, quietly, she would write letters.</em></p>
<p><em>I… remember.</em></p>
<p><em>The figures of that person, and of my kindly smiling mother.</em></p>

<hr>
<p><strong>The Girl and the Auto-Memories Doll</strong></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Ghostwriting</strong> was a profession that had existed since ancient times. It had once come to a point of decay due to the popularization of Auto-Memories Dolls, yet professions with long-standing history were loved and protected by no small amount of people. The increase in number of copyist machine dolls was precisely what caused <strong><u>nostalgic</u></strong> hobbyists to claim that old-fashioned professions were better off keeping their charm.</p>
<p>The mother of Ann Magnolia used to be one of those people with a fascinatingly old-fashioned taste.</p>
<p>With her naturally wavy dark hair, <strong><u>freckle</u></strong>s and slender body, Ann’s mother had been almost exactly like Ann herself in looks, as well as someone who had come from a wealthy household. Raised as an elite woman, she had gotten married, and, even after aging, something about her had still resembled a ‘young lady’. The gentle smile she would wear whenever letting out a high-pitched laughter was childish to whomever saw it.</p>
<p>Looking back on how her mother used to be, even now, Ann thought she that was like a little girl. Vigorous in spite of being a clumsy person, whenever she would enthusiastically assert, “I wish to give this a try!”, Ann would <strong><u>retort</u></strong> with, “My, my, again?”. She had been fond of boat rides and dog races, as well as oriental flower arrangements found in quilt <strong><u>embroidery</u></strong>. She was a person who used to love learning and had a hobbyist side to her, and whenever she went to the theaters, it would be definitely to watch romance plays. Keen as she had been on laces and ribbons, her dresses and one-pieces were mostly similar to those of princesses from fairytales. She used to impose them on her daughter, as she fancied parent-child matching outfits. Ann would sometimes wonder what could be wrong with her mother for wearing ribbons at her age, but had never once voiced it.</p>
<p>Ann had treasured her mother more than anyone in the world – even more than her own existence. Albeit being a small child, she used to deem herself as the only one that could protect her mother, who was not a strong person by any means.</p>
<p>She had loved her mother that blindly.</p>
<p>Around the time when her mother had fallen ill and the date of her passing was approaching, Ann had her first meeting with an Auto-Memories Doll. Even though she had countless memories with her mother, the ones Ann would recall were always about the days when they had welcomed a mysterious visitor.</p>
<hr>
<p>‘It’ showed up on a very sunny spring day.</p>
<p>The road bathed in abundant sunrays of a beautiful spring. Next to it, the flowers that had started to bloom from within the thaw swayed along the feeble wind, their tips shaking.</p>
<p>From her home’s garden, Ann was observing the way ‘it’ walked.</p>
<p>Ann’s mother lived in the uppermost left side of an old but stylish western-architecture building, which she had inherited from her family. With its white walls and blue roof tiles, surrounded by huge birch trees, the place was like an illustration from a children’s book.</p>
<p>The residence was <strong><u>peripheral</u></strong>, having been built <strong><u>secluded</u></strong> and quite far from their prospering town. Even if one were to search in every direction, no neighboring houses could be found. That was why, were there ever any guests coming, they could easily be sighted through the windows.</p>
<p>“What… is that?”</p>
<p>Clad in a smock one-piece that had a large, cyan-striped ribbon collar, Ann looked a bit ordinary yet lovely. It almost seemed her dark brown eyes would jump out of her head, given how wide-open they were.</p>
<p>Ann then <strong><u>peeled</u></strong> her pupils off ‘it’, which marched towards her direction under the sunlight, and hurried out of the garden and back into her house with her flowery enamel shoes. She passed the huge front entrance, climbed the spiral staircase filled with family portraits and burst open a door decorated with a lease made out of pink roses.</p>
<p>“Mom!”</p>
<p>As her daughter breathlessly <strong><u>barged</u></strong> in, the mother <strong><u>reprehend</u></strong>ed, raising her body a little on her bed, “Ann, do I not always tell you that you must knock before entering someone’s room? Also, you should give your greetings.”</p>
<p>Upon being lectured, Ann <strong><u>inwardly</u></strong> <strong><u>huffed</u></strong>, yet lowered her hips, pinched her skirt’s <strong><u>hem</u></strong> and bowed regardless.</p>
<p>Did the action stem from her so-called “little lady side”? In actuality, Ann was a mere infant. It had been no longer than seven years ever since she had been born. Her limbs and face still appeared soft.</p>
<p>“Mom, excuse me.”</p>
<p>“Very well. Then, what is it? Did you find a <strong><u>peculiar</u></strong> insect outside again? Do not show it to Mom, all right?”</p>
<p>“It’s not a bug! A doll is walking over. Erm, it was really big for a doll, though, and it looked like one of those bisque dolls from that photo collection you like, Mom,” with her limited vocabulary, Ann spoke as though having a coughing fit.</p>
<p>The mother clicked her tongue at her with a “tsk, tsk”. “A ‘young female doll’, right?”</p>
<p>“Come on, Mom!”</p>
<p>“You are a daughter of the Magnolia family, so your wording should be more graceful. Okay, one more time.”</p>
<p>Puffing her cheeks, Ann reluctantly fixed her manner of speech, “There’s this young female doll, you see! She’s walking!”</p>
<p>“My, is that so?”</p>
<p>“Only cars pass by our house all the time, right? If she’s on foot, it means she got off at the nearby railroad terminal. People who come from that terminal are bound to be our visitors, right?”</p>
<p>“That is correct.”</p>
<p>“Like, nothing ever happens around here! It must mean that woman will be coming to this place!” Ann added, “I… have a feeling that’s not a good thing.”</p>
<p>“So we are playing detective today, huh?” in contrast with the frantic Ann, her mother concluded leisurely.</p>
<p>“I’m not playing around! Hey, let’s close every door and window… Let’s make it so that this doll… this young female doll… won’t come inside! It’s alright, I’ll protect Mom.”</p>
<p>The mother gave Ann, who determinedly snuffled through her nose, a strained smile. She probably believed that her child was but <strong>spout</strong>ing nonsense. Even so, she decided to go along with the game at the very least, getting up in a <strong><u>lethargic</u></strong> fashion. With the hem of her peach-colored <strong>negligee</strong> dragging along the floor, she stood next to the window. Under the natural light, the silhouette of her slim body could be seen from beneath the fabric.</p>
<p>“My, isn’t that an Auto-Memories Doll? Come to think of it, she was supposed to arrive today!”</p>
<p>“What’s an ‘Auto-Memories Doll’…?”</p>
<p>“I will explain later, Ann. Help me get ready!”</p>
<p>A few minutes thereafter, the mother sought her daughter to arrange her in the stylishness demanded from the Magnolia family. Ann did not change her clothes, but had a ribbon that matched the color of her smock one-piece placed on her head. Her mother, on the other hand, put on an ivory-colored dress with double-layered lace frills, as well as a light yellow <strong>shawl</strong> over her shoulders and rose-shaped earrings. She sprayed a perfume made of thirty different types of flowers in the air and spun around, enveloping her body with the fragrance.</p>
<p>“Mom, are you excited?”</p>
<p>“Even more than if I were to meet a foreign prince.”</p>
<p>That had not been a joke. The outfit her mother had chosen was the kind she would only wear for important occasions. Watching her in such state caused Ann to fidget.</p>
<p><em>——I don’t like this… It would have been fine if there weren’t any guests coming…</em></p>
<p>Ann’s <strong><u>fidgeting</u></strong> was not out of delight.</p>
<p>Children would normally look forward to visitors while feeling a bit nervous, but Ann was different. That was because, from the moment she had become aware of the things around her, she had deducted that any visitors coming for her innocent mother would fool her to get their hands on her money. Her mother was a carefree person and visits always made her happy, so she was quick to trust anyone. Ann loved her mother, but the latter’s poor <strong><u>monetary</u></strong> management abilities and scarce sense of danger were troublesome.</p>
<p>There was no guarantee that even the person with doll-like looks was not after the possession of their residence. Yet what Ann felt more <strong><u>wary</u></strong> of was how she could tell with just a glance that the woman’s appearance resonated with her mother’s taste. To Ann, her mother being invested in anyone other than herself was nothing but unpleasant.</p>
<p>Since her mother had claimed, “I want to hurry and meet her!” and not listened to Ann, the two of them had come outside to greet the guest. Ann assisted her mother, who was out of breath just from descending the stairs, as they walked outside.</p>
<p>The world overflowed with sunlight pouring from the gaps between tree branches and leaves. The whiteness from the pale skin of her mother, who usually only moved around inside the mansion, stood out too much.</p>
<p><em>——Mom is… somewhat smaller than she used to be.</em></p>
<p>She could not clearly see her mother’s face in the excess of brightness, but had a feeling that her wrinkles had increased. Ann then squeezed her chest tightly.</p>
<p>No one could stop death from reaching out to a sickly hand.</p>
<p>Although Ann was a small child, she was the Magnolia family’s sole successor after her mother. <strong><u>Medics</u></strong> had already warned that her mother’s life would be short. She had also been told to prepare herself. God was not easy even on seven-year-olds.</p>
<p><em>——If that’s the case, I want Mom all for myself until the very end.</em></p>
<p>If her mother’s time was running out, Ann wanted to use it entirely for her sake. Into the world of the girl who had such a mindset, a stranger intruded.</p>
<p>“Pardon me.”</p>
<p>Something even more radiant emerged from the sun-bathed green road. As soon as Ann saw ‘it’, her bad feeling was confirmed.</p>
<p><em>——Aah, she’s someone that will rob Mom from me.</em></p>
<p>Why did she have such a thought? Upon looking at ‘its’ figure, she could only say that it had been her intuition speaking.</p>
<p>‘It’ was a bewitchingly beautiful doll.</p>
<p>Golden hair that shone as though born out of moonlight. Blue <strong><u>orbs</u></strong> that glowed like gems. Bright <strong>rouge-colored</strong> lips so <strong>plump</strong> as to seem they had been pressed hard. A Prussian-blue jacket under a ribbon-tie snow-white dress that bore a mismatched emerald brooch. Cocoa-brown knit-up boots that stepped steadily onto the ground.</p>
<p>Resting a <strong>frilly</strong>, white and cyan-striped umbrella and bag onto the grass, ‘it’ displayed an etiquette much more elegant than Ann in front of the two. “Pleased to make your acquaintance. I rush to anywhere my customers might desire. I am from the Auto-Memories Dolls service, Violet Evergarden,” ‘its’ voice, just as exquisite as ‘its’ appearance, resounded in their ears.</p>
<p>After overcoming her shock from being overwhelmed by such beauty, Ann looked at her mother, who was at ease next to her. Expression painted like a little girl that had just fallen in love, stars twinkled in her eyes out of amazement.</p>
<p><em>——And, as expected, that’s no good.</em></p>
<p>Ann thought of the stunning guest as someone bound to steal her mother away from her.</p>
<h1 id="P2"><a href="#P2" class="headerlink" title="P2"></a>P2</h1><hr>
<p>Violet Evergarden was a woman who worked as a so-called “Auto-Memories Doll” in the ghostwriting business. Ann questioned her mother as to why she had hired someone of that sort.</p>
<p>“I wish to write letters to someone, but they will take too long, so I wanted her to write in my stead,” her mother laughed.</p>
<p>Indeed, she lately relied on her maid even when bathing. Writing for an extended period would certainly be too extreme for her.</p>
<p>“Still, why that person…?”</p>
<p>“She’s pretty, isn’t she?”</p>
<p>“She is, but…”</p>
<p>“She is a celebrity in the industry. The fact that she is so attractive and doll-like is one of the reasons of her fame, but she is rumored to do really a good job as well! Moreover, having a woman write letters for me while we are by ourselves, and having to recite it to her aloud… one does not need to be a man for this to cause shudders!”</p>
<p>Her mother valued the beautiful, and Ann was convinced that was the main motive why the young woman had been chosen.</p>
<p>“If it’s just letters, I could do the writing.”</p>
<p>At Ann’s statement, her mother giggled nervously. “Ann cannot possibly write difficult words yet. Besides… these are letters that I cannot have you write.”</p>
<p>With her last sentence, it was clear who the one doing the writing would be.</p>
<p><em>——Surely, she intends to write to Dad, huh…</em></p>
<p>Ann’s father was, simply put, a family abandoner. He had never stayed home albeit not working so much, prospering in taking over the family’s main business. Apparently, her mother had married him out of love, but Ann did not believe it in the slightest. Not once had he visited her mother after she had become ill, and just when they had thought that he was going to come back after some time had passed, he had actually only stopped by to take vases and paintings from the house and sell them, as he was a pitiful man who took refuge in gambling and alcohol.</p>
<p>It seemed he had been a family heir with a promising future in the past. Yet a few years after getting married, his side of the family had faced minor commercial issues and crumbled, and the finances had become dependent on the Magnolias. From what Ann had heard, it would seem that the reason behind said minor commercial issues had been her father himself.</p>
<p>Ann swallowed down all the circumstances and despised her father. Even though he had collapsed once due to business failure, should he not have continued to do his best? Not only had he not done so, but he had also turned a blind eye to her mother’s disease and necessities, continuously running away. That was why Ann’s expression would distort just by hearing the word “father” coming out of her mother’s mouth.</p>
<p>“Making this kind of face again… What a waste of your cute features.”</p>
<p>A massaging thumb stretched out the creasing between Ann’s eyebrows. Her mother seemed to lament the hatred towards her father. It appeared that her affection for him had remained even while being treated so terribly.</p>
<p>“Do not think severely of your father. Bad things do not last. This is just what he wishes to do at the moment. He has lived his whole life seriously. That is the truth. Although our paths slightly differ now, if we wait, he will properly return to us someday.”</p>
<p>Ann was aware that such days would not come. Even if they did, she had no intention to welcome them warmly. Should things turn out the way her unwittingly wavering mother had predicted, the fact that he did not come see his wife even as she had become terminally sick and repeatedly found herself hospitalized was not an escapism from reality, but an act of love.</p>
<p>At the very least, he supposedly knew that she did not have much time left.</p>
<p><em>——It’s fine without Dad around.</em></p>
<p>It was as if he had not been there from the start. For Ann, her mother was the only one who classified in the word “family”. Moreover, those who saddened her mother were her enemies, even if one of them was her own father. Anyone who would steal her time with her mother, too. And should that apply to the Auto-Memories Doll who had come as per her mother’s request, she would be an enemy as well.</p>
<p><em>——Mom is mine.</em></p>
<p>Ann marked anything that could destroy hers and her mother’s world as a foe.</p>
<hr>
<p>Her mother and Violet started the process of writing letters seated at a table on antique white benches under an umbrella arranged in the garden. Their contract period was of one week. It seemed that her mother really did intend to make Violet write incredibly long letters. Perhaps they were addressed to several people.</p>
<p>Back when she was healthy, her mother used to often throw salon parties and invite many friends over to the manor. However, she currently had no contact or involvement with those people anymore.</p>
<p>“So there’s no meaning in writing them…”</p>
<p>Ann did not come near the two, spying on their actions while hiding behind the curtains instead. She had been told to not disturb when her mother’s letters were being written.</p>
<p><em>“There’s need for privacy even between parents and children, right?”</em></p>
<p>It was a cruel demand for Ann, who had always been glued to her mother.</p>
<p>“I wonder what they’re talking about. Who is she writing it to? I’m curious…” She squeezed her cheek against the window frame.</p>
<p>Serving them tea and snacks was not up to Ann, but to the maid. Therefore, she was unable to put on a good girl façade for the sake of eavesdropping on their internal affairs. All she could do was watch, just as she could not do anything about her mother’s illness.</p>
<p>“I wonder why life has to be like this…” she attempted to spew out an adult-like line, but since she was a seven-year-old, it did not have any effect.</p>
<p>As she continued observing them with an unkempt facial expression, she was able to take notice of many things. The two worked very quietly, yet they occasionally seemed to either become quite solemn or be enjoying themselves a great deal. During the fun moments, her mother would laugh loudly and smack her hand down with force. During the sad ones, she would wipe her tears with a handkerchief lent by Violet.</p>
<p>Her mother was a person of intense emotional vicissitudes. Even so, Ann thought, was she not opening her heart too much to someone she had barely just met?</p>
<p><em>——Mom will be deceived again…</em></p>
<p>Ann had learned the ruthlessness, indifference, betrayal and greed of people through her mother. She worried tremendously about the latter, who was too fast to confide in anyone. She wished her mother would simply figure out how to be suspicious of others. Yet, perhaps her mother did intend to entrust that Auto-Memories Doll, Violet Evergarden, with whatever mystery was hidden within her heart.</p>
<hr>
<p>During her stay, Violet was introduced in the household as a guest.</p>
<p>At mealtime, the mother had invited the young woman to join them but was declined. When Ann asked why, Violet had coldly replied, “Because I wish to eat by myself, Young Mistress.”</p>
<p>Ann found her odd. Whenever her mother was hospitalized, no matter how warm the meals prepared by the maid were, they tasted of nothing. Food that she had to eat alone was purely too irksome.</p>
<p>That was what meals were about.</p>
<p>As she caught the maid off to deliver Violet’s dinner to her room, Ann claimed that she would be the one to do so. In order to know the enemy, she first needed to interact with her.</p>
<p>The menu was soft bread, vegetable soup with chicken and colorful beans, fried potatoes and onions garnished with salt, garlic and pepper, roasted beef with sauce and pear sherbet as dessert. That was the usual in the Magnolia house. Although it could be considered rather luxurious, as Ann had grown up in a wealthy environment, it felt plain to her.</p>
<p>“There’s no helping that Mom overlooked this. We need to increase the amount of meat for tomorrow. And no sherbets; it has to be a cake. In a way… she’s a guest.”</p>
<p>Not forgetting about hospitality regardless of anything was the gift of good families.</p>
<p>As she reached an oak wood door – the one of the guest room –, she called, as her hands were occupied with a tray, “Heeey, it’s dinner time.”</p>
<p>Rustling sounds came from inside, and, after a pause, Violet opened the door and poked her head out.</p>
<p>As she did so, Ann grumbled, “It’s heavy. Hurry and take it!”</p>
<p>“I am terribly sorry, Young Mistress,” she immediately accepted the tray with an apology, but as her expression was too apathetic, in the eyes of a child, she looked eerie.</p>
<p>Ann peeked through the open door from behind Violet, who placed the tray on a desk. Since the maid cleaned the room regularly, it was arranged neatly. Ann then noticed the luggage lying conspicuously on the bed. It was a leather trolley bag clammily filled with customs clearance stickers from various countries. The bag was open, a small pistol protruding from within.</p>
<p>In the split moment that an “ah” crossed her mind, Violet returned. Just as would happen in a pantomime show, the two of them continuously moved in perfect synchrony. Eventually, Violet lost her wit.</p>
<p>“Young Mistress, is a gun something usual for you?”</p>
<p>“What’s up with that? Hey, is it a real one?”</p>
<p>As Ann inquired excitedly, Violet answered, “Self-defense is a necessity for women who travel alone, after all.”</p>
<p>“What’s ‘self-defense’?”</p>
<p>“To protect oneself, Young Mistress.”</p>
<p>As Violet narrowed her eyes slightly, Ann’s body trembled at the movement of her lips. Had she been a little older, the girl would probably have recognized her own reaction as a sign of fascination.</p>
<p>A woman capable of numbing people with her voice and gestures was a magical one. Ann felt far more threatened by Violet’s charms than the fact that she carried firearm.</p>
<p>“So you… shoot that thing?”</p>
<p>As she imitated the shape of a pistol with her hands, Violet straightened her arm immediately. “Please enclose the sides more. If your hand is loose, you become unable to withstand the recoil.”</p>
<p>“This isn’t the real deal. It’s a finger.”</p>
<p>“Even so, it should be enough to serve as practice for a time when you could possibly need it.”</p>
<p>What was that Auto-Memories Doll saying to an infant?</p>
<p>“Don’t you know? Women aren’t supposed to use these kinds of things.”</p>
<p>“There is no separating women from men when it comes to possessing guns,” Violet replied without hesitation, and Ann thought she was the coolest.</p>
<p>“Why do you have that with you?”</p>
<p>“The next place I will be dispatched to is an area of conflict… Be at ease. I shall not use it here.”</p>
<p>“Obviously!”</p>
<p>At Ann’s sharp attitude, Violet lightly forced a question out of curiosity, “Is there no such arming in this mansion?”</p>
<p>“Normal homes don’t have that.”</p>
<p>Violet gave her a puzzled look. “Then what do you do in case a thief ever appears…?” Seeming truly doubtful, she tilted her head. As she did so, her doll-like features stood out even further.</p>
<p>“If someone like that shows up, everyone will know right away. This is the countryside, after all. It was the same when you arrived.”</p>
<p>“I see. This could explain the low crime rate in depopulate areas.” Nodding as if that had been a lesson, she looked like a child despite being an adult.</p>
<p>“You’re… kinda… weird,” Ann declared tensely, pointing an index finger at Violet.</p>
<p>Although she had merely said so out of spite, at that instant, the corners of Violet’s mouth rose just a little for the first time. “Young Mistress, should you not be going to sleep? Staying up late is prejudicial for women.”</p>
<p>Due to the unexpected smile, Ann was blown away to a certain degree and could say nothing else. Tinted red, her cheeks denounced the truth behind her palpitations.</p>
<p>“I-I willsleep. You should sleep too, or else, Mom will scold you.”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“If you stay up even later than this, monsters will come to tell you that you have to go sleep.”</p>
<p>“Goodnight, Young Mistress.”</p>
<p>Ann could not bear staying there or even standing on her feet anymore, leaving the place in a rush. However, as she walked away, she found herself curious no matter what, glancing backwards the very next second. She could see Violet holding the gun beyond the door that was still half-open. Violet’s expressions were mostly deadpan, and so, it was hard to tell her mood changes. Nevertheless, even the all-too-young Ann could understand what she had seemed to feel at that moment with just a look.</p>
<p><em>——Ah, somewhat…</em></p>
<p>She was somewhat lonely.</p>
<p>Incompatible with her current appearance, she held onto a brutal, fierce weapon. Ann could hardly imagine growing attached to her, yet she was becoming familiar with the black gloves covering Violet’s hands. Using those two hands, Violet pressed the rib part of the gun that she was gripping against her forehead with a bump. Her figure was similar to someone uttering a prayer, which pilgrims would often do. Before Ann turned around the hall’s corner, her ears were able to catch said prayer.</p>
<p>“Please, give me an order,”she asked somebody.</p>
<p>Ann’s chest suddenly began to thump faster.</p>
<p><em>——My face is hot. It stings.</em></p>
<p>She did not understand very well why her heart beat so rapidly, but it was because she had caught a glimpse of a woman’s adult side from Violet.</p>
<p><em>——How strange. Even though I don’t like that person, I’m interested in her.</em></p>
<p>Interest was just a step behind of romantic love. Ann did not yet know that, sometimes, feelings such as ‘like’ and ‘dislike’ could easily reverse.</p>
<hr>
<p>Ann’s observation of Violet went on even after that. The progress of writing letters seemed to be doing well, for the bundle of envelopes had increased. Violet would glance discreetly at her direction every now and then, causing her to wonder if the woman was aware of her peeking through the window. At those moments, Ann’s heart would throb. She ended up acquiring the habit of grabbing onto her chest, to the point her clothes crumpled in that spot.</p>
<p>The little girl continued to change.</p>
<p>“Hey, hey. Hey, I said. Put a ribbon on my hair.”</p>
<p>“Understood.”</p>
<p>Although she was sad about her mother being monopolized, she could not bring herself to feel angry.</p>
<p>“What’s a bread so hard that you can’t bite through?”</p>
<p>“I believe any will soften if dipped into soup; is that not the case?”</p>
<p>During the breaks in-between the letters’ writing, Ann would inadvertently chase after and spend time with her.</p>
<p>“Violet, Violet.”</p>
<p>“Yes, Young Mistress?”</p>
<p>Before realizing, instead of being referred to with a demeaning “you”, she was being called by her name.</p>
<p>“Violet, read me books, dance with me and catch bugs with me outside!”</p>
<p>“Please state the priority order, Young Mistress.”</p>
<p>Violet was challenging to stick with, but did not neglect her in any way.</p>
<p><em>——What a weird person. I kind of also become weird when I’m with her.</em></p>
<p>Albeit resenting it, Ann became obsessed with Violet.</p>
<hr>
<p>The peaceful times met a sudden end later on.</p>
<p>Ann’s mother had become a little healthier a couple of days after Violet’s arrival, but her already poor physical condition gradually worsened. Perhaps it had been a mistake to expose herself to the wind outside. She had a fever, and the fuss over it came to the point that a doctor was called over to the manor. But even in such a situation, she and Violet did not halt their work. The mother lay on her bed while Violet resumed typing the letters, sitting next to it.</p>
<p>Uneasy at the change in her mother’s condition, Ann worriedly came to see how things were going in the room and to persuade her. She meant to make her stop writing the letters.</p>
<p>It would be a problem if she let the flame of what life she had left dissipate because of mere letters. That was most definitely unacceptable. Even as Ann was negated to, she forcefully entered the room with continuous objections.</p>
<p>“Why do you push yourself so hard to write these letters? The doctors say it’s useless…”</p>
<p>“If I do not write them now, I might never be able to. It is all right. See, it is… because my head is not doing so well that, when I was reciting, I ended up having this psychological fever. How unpleasant…”</p>
<p>Her mother smiled weakly, but she was unable to reciprocate. It was a smile that pierced Ann’s heart.</p>
<p>The joyful moments had disappeared as if they had been a lie and the bitter reality had abruptly come back.</p>
<p>“Mom, stop it already.”</p>
<p>Although her mother had been fine ten seconds before, she could stop breathing in a matter of three or so minutes. The sorrow of living with someone in such circumstances wound up resurfacing.</p>
<p>“Please, don’t write these letters anymore.”</p>
<p>If doing so would earn her fevers… if doing so would shorten her life…</p>
<p>“Please, please…”</p>
<p>…even were it something that her mother wished for, Ann did not wish her to do it.</p>
<p>“Just stop it!”</p>
<p>Her accumulated anxiety and depression burst out at that instant. Even Ann herself was surprised by her own voice, which had come out much louder than she had imagined it would.</p>
<p>In that moment, she ended up spewing at once the selfishness that she would normally not vent out, “Mom, why don’t you ever listen to me? Do you prefer being with Violet over me? Why do you not look at me?!”</p>
<p>It might have been better for her to have said it in a more lovable manner. She had accidentally let her distress show.</p>
<p>With a shaky tone, she wound up asking in an accusing way, “Am I… not needed?”</p>
<p>All she had wanted was to be looked after.</p>
<p>Her mother shook her head with wide eyes at those words. “That is not it. There is no way that would be the case. What is the matter, Ann?” She panicked in an attempt to lift the mood.</p>
<p>Ann evaded the hand that stretched out to pat her head. She did not want to be touched.</p>
<p>“You don’t listen at all to anything I say.”</p>
<p>“That’s because I’m writing these letters.”</p>
<p>“Are the letters more important than me?”</p>
<p>“Ann, there’s nothing more important than you.”</p>
<p>“Liar…!”</p>
<p>“It’s not a lie.”</p>
<p>Her mother’s voice was internal and full of grief. Still, Ann did not stop her arguments from coming. Her resentment towards how things were not going the way she hoped bled out of her.</p>
<p>“Liar! You’ve always been a liar! Every time… Every time, it’s only lies! Mom, you haven’t recovered in the slightest! Even though you said you’d get better again!”</p>
<p>After having said it, as it was something she should not have uttered, Ann immediately regretted it. Such was the kind of line that would normally be said in a fight devoid of love between parent and child. But that day was an exception. Her mother, red-faced from the fever, remained smiling while growing silent.</p>
<p>“Mom, hey…” Ann called out to her in that state. The spur-of-momentum heat was suddenly gone. Yet, as she tried to speak, her mouth was covered by a touch.</p>
<p>“Ann, please, leave for a bit.”</p>
<p>Tears spilled from the eyes of her whispering mother. The large droplets quivered loose and eventually cascaded down her cheeks. Ann was shocked that her mother, who perpetually smiled despite the pain she had to endure from her disease, was actually letting her tears be seen.</p>
<p><em>——Mom is crying.</em></p>
<p>Since her mother was not the type to cry, Ann had believed adults to be creatures that never shed tears. After realizing that was not the case, the fact she had done something terrible rang within her mind.</p>
<p><em>——I’ve hurt Mom.</em></p>
<p>Even though Ann knew that she, more than anyone, was not supposed to place herself before her mother, and even though she was convinced that the task of protecting her mother the most was up to her, she had made the latter cry.</p>
<p>“M-Mo…” she attempted to apologize, but was driven away by Violet, who proceeded to drag her out of the room as if dealing with a dog cub. “Stop! Let go! Let go!” Ann exclaimed, left alone in the corridor as she was unable to put up resistance.</p>
<p>Her mother’s sobs could be heard from the other side of the closed door.</p>
<p>“M… Mom…” She clung to the door, distraught. “Hey, Mom …”</p>
<p><em>——Sorry. Sorry for making you cry. That wasn’t my intention.</em></p>
<p>“Mom! Mom!”</p>
<p><em>——I just wanted you to take care of your own body. So that… So that… I could be with you even for a second longer, if possible.</em></p>
<p>“Mom…”</p>
<p><em>——That was it.</em></p>
<p>“Mom, hey!”</p>
<p><em>——Is this… my fault?</em></p>
<p>Due to the frustration from not receiving any response, her loneliness reverberated. She tried banging her fists against the door violently. However, even without hurting, her hands became weak and numbly fell down.</p>
<p><em>——Was I being selfish?</em></p>
<p>A mother who was at death’s doorstep. A daughter that would be left on her own.</p>
<p><em>——Was being together with her… something so bad to wish for?</em></p>
<p>A mother who kept writing letters, for she might not be able to do so in the future. A daughter that hated it.</p>
<p>The tears that had dried out were on the verge of overflowing again. Ann inhaled deeply and yelled in one breath, “Is someone else more important to Mom than me?!” As her shouts came out, she started bawling. Her voice was muffled, her timbre cracking. “Mom, don’t be writing letters and spend time with me!” the child begged.</p>
<p>Wailing when their requests could not be fulfilled was simply what children did.</p>
<p>“Without Mom, I’ll be alone! All by myself! How long will this last? I want to be with Mom for as much time as I can. If I’ll be on my own after this, stop writing these letters… For now, be with me! With me!”</p>
<p>That was it; Ann was but a child.</p>
<p>“Be with me…”</p>
<p>Still too young to be able to do anything, she was a mere child that had lived for barely seven years and adored her mother.</p>
<p>“I want to… be with you…”</p>
<p>She was someone who, in fact, had always, always wept over the fate granted to her by God.</p>
<p>“Young Mistress.”</p>
<p>Violet came out of the room. She stared down at Ann, whose face was wet with tears. Just as the girl had thought that was clearly a cold treatment, a hand made its way to her shoulder. The warmth of the act abated her hostility.</p>
<p>“There is a reason for me to be robbing your time with your mother. Please do not resent her.”</p>
<p>“But… But… But…!”</p>
<p>Violet crouched down to meet the small Ann’s line of sight. “It is evident that Young Mistress is strong. Even with such a small body, you have already acknowledged your mother’s disease. Children usually will not complain or care for someone to this extent. You are a highly respectable person, Young Mistress Ann.”</p>
<p>“That’s not it. That’s not it at all… I just… wanted to be with Mom for a little more…”</p>
<p>“Madam feels the same way.”</p>
<p>Violet’s words sounded like nothing but pity.</p>
<p>“Lies, lies, lies, lies… I mean… she’s concerned about those letters for someone that I don’t know rather than about me. Even though there’s no one else in this house that really worries for Mom!”</p>
<p><em>——Everyone, <strong>everyone</strong> is all about money.</em></p>
<p>“I’m the only one… I’m the only one who cares for Mom!”</p>
<p>The way her dark brown eyes saw it, adults and everything related to them were wrapped in fabrications.</p>
<p>Her shoulders shivered as her tears trickled to the floor. Distorted by said tears, her vision was as blurry as the world felt to her. Just how many things in that world were actually real?</p>
<p>“Even so…”</p>
<p>The young girl believed that, regardless of how long she would live afterwards, if the world was filled with so much hypocrisy and treachery from the very start of one’s life, the future did not have to come.</p>
<p>“Even so…”</p>
<p>The amount of things Ann deemed as true could be counted with one hand. They shone unrelentingly in such a false world. With them, she could tolerate any sort of dread.</p>
<p>“This is how it is… but even so…”</p>
<p><em>——Even though I wouldn’t need anything else as long as Mom was with me…</em></p>
<p>“Even so, Mom doesn’t love me the most!”</p>
<p>As Ann yelled, Violet placed an index finger against her lips at a speed that could not be perceived by human eyes. Ann’s body quivered for a moment. Her voice ceased seamlessly. In the quiet corridor, her mother’s sobs could still be heard from behind the door.</p>
<p>“If it is about me, you can be as angry as you will. Hit me, kick me; I will not mind whatever you feel like doing. However… please refrain from using words that would sadden your beloved, honorable mother, for your own sake as well.”</p>
<p>As Ann was told so with a severe face, tears started to rapidly form in her eyes again. The cries that she suppressed and swallowed back in were fresh and painful.</p>
<p>“Am I in the wrong?”</p>
<p>“No, there is not a single thing that you are to blame for.”</p>
<p>“Because I’m a bad child, Mom became sick, and… will soon…”</p>
<p><em>——…die?</em></p>
<p>Violet answered Ann’s question in a whisper with a tone that was still a little dispassionate but unperturbed, “No.”</p>
<p>The tears poured from Ann’s stroppy eyes.</p>
<p>“No, Young Mistress is a very kind person. Illnesses are unrelated to this. It is… something that no one can predict or do anything about. Just as I can no longer have a skin as soft as yours in place of my robotic arms, it is something that cannot be helped.”</p>
<p>“Then, is it God’s fault?”</p>
<p>“Even if it were, even if it were not… we can only concentrate in how we should live the lives that we have been granted.”</p>
<p>“What… should I do?”</p>
<p>“For now, Young Mistress… you are free to cry.” Violet opened her arms, her machine parts letting out a faint noise. “If you will not hit me, is it all right if I lend you my body instead?”</p>
<p>That could be interpreted as “you can jump on and hug me”, even though she did not seem like the type to say such things. Ann could cry securely, so to speak. Without hesitation, she embraced Violet.</p>
<p>Was she wearing any perfume? She smelled of several different flowers.</p>
<p>“Violet, don’t take Mom away from me,” she said as she tightly pressed her face against Violet’s chest, soaking it with tears, “Don’t steal my time with Mom, Violet.”</p>
<p>“Please forgive it for only a few more days.”</p>
<p>“Then, at least tell Mom that it’s okay if I stay by her side while you’re writing. It’s fine if you two ignore me; I just want to be close to her. I want to be by her side and squeeze her hand tight.”</p>
<p>“I apologize, but my client is Madam, not Young Mistress Ann. There is nothing I can do to change this.”</p>
<p>_——I really can’t stand adults after all, _Ann thought.</p>
<p>“I hate you… Violet.”</p>
<p>“My deepest apologies, Young Mistress.”</p>
<p>“Why do you write letters?”</p>
<p>“Because people have feelings that they wish to deliver to others.”</p>
<p>Ann knew she was not the center of the world. Regardless, the fact that things never went as she desired caused more tears to pour down out of frustration.</p>
<p>“Things like that don’t need to be delivered…”</p>
<p>Violet merely continued to hug the frowning Ann, who bit her lip out of displeasure. “There is no such thing as a letter that needn’t be delivered, Young Mistress.”</p>
<p>It seemed her words were directed at herself rather than at the girl. Ann pondered over why. Because of that, the phrase was somehow strikingly engraved in her mind.</p>
<hr>
<p>The time that Ann Magnolia spent together with Violet Evergarden was of only a week. Her mother managed to finish writing the letters one way or another, and Violet reticently left the mansion once the contract period was over.</p>
<p>“You’re going somewhere dangerous, right?”</p>
<p>“Yes, since someone awaits me there.”</p>
<p>“Aren’t you scared?”</p>
<p>“I rush anywhere a client might desire. This is what the Auto-Memories Doll Violet Evergarden is about.”</p>
<p>“Can I call you over if I someday meet someone I’d want to write letters to?” was what Ann could not bring herself to inquire.</p>
<p>What if the woman died at the place her next client was? Even should she not, what if Ann ended up never finding someone she would like to write to? Thinking about that, she was unable to ask it.</p>
<p>While being seen off, Violet turned around only once and waved at her.</p>
<hr>
<p>It was several months after the woman had left that the disease of Ann’s mother reached its worst. She soon passed away. The ones who took care of her in her last moments were Ann and her maid.</p>
<p>Until she closed her eyes, Ann continuously whispered, “I love you, Mom.”</p>
<p>Her mother simply nodded slowly. “Yes, yes.”</p>
<p>On a calm day of a quiet spring, her dear mother passed away.</p>
<p>From that point on, Ann became extremely busy. In regards of her heirloom, after a discussion with lawyers, she decided to freeze the family’s multiple bank accounts until she was of age, summoned a private tutor to the manor and studied hard. As it was difficult for her to part ways with the land that bore deep memories of her mother, she obtained qualification for a bachelor’s degree through correspondence education.</p>
<p>She never again saw her father. He had attended the funeral, but they had barely exchanged two or three words.</p>
<p>After her mother died, he completely stopped coming home. His recklessness with money ended as well. Ann did not ask directly the reason behind his change of mindset, but believed it to have been a good one.</p>
<p>Ann opened a law counseling office at home after graduating. She did not earn that much, but she no longer had a maid, so it was about enough for her to sustain herself. She was also in the middle of a small love affair with a young entrepreneur who often came for counseling.</p>
<p>As she did not succumb to sorrow even after having lost her mother at seven years of age, people would ask, “How come you don’t break down?”</p>
<p>To that, Ann would answer, “Because my mother is always looking after me.”</p>
<p>Her mother was, of course, deceased. Her bones resided in a family grave where their relatives had been buried for generations.</p>
<p>Yet Ann would say, “My mother has been rectifying and guiding me all this time. Even now.”</p>
<p>There was a reason why she would affirm that while smiling. It was connected all the way to the time that she had spent with Violet Evergarden.</p>
<p>Ann’s eighth birthday had been the first after her mother had passed on. A package had arrived for her on said day. It had contained a big stuffed bear with a red ribbon. The name of the sender was of her late mother, the present accompanied by a letter.</p>
<p><em>Happy 8th birthday, Ann. Many sad things might have happened. There may be several others to work hard on. But do not give in. Although you might be lonely and crying desolately, do not forget: Mom will always love you, Ann.</em></p>
<p>It had been unmistakably her mother’s handwriting. At that instant, the image of Violet Evergarden had resurfaced in the back of Ann’s mind. Had it gotten mixed with the letters she had ghostwritten? If that were the case, it would be unnatural. In the past, although her mother had said that she was going to write letters, everything had been penned by Violet Evergarden. Could it be that the Auto-Memories Doll had gone as far as imitating her mother’s handwriting?</p>
<p>In shock, upon questioning the postal agency that had delivered it, Ann had been informed that the company had signed a long-term contract with her mother and was supposed to send gifts on her birthday every year. Moreover, the certain someone who had written the letter was Violet Evergarden, and all the other letters transcribed by her had been carefully stored.</p>
<p>Ann did not receive an answer when asking for how long the letters would be delivered due to contractual secrecy, but they had arrived every single following year. Even as she had turned 14.</p>
<p><em>You have already become a wonderful lady by now. I wonder if you have found a young man that you like. Your way of speaking and attitude are a little boyish, so be careful.</em></p>
<p><em>I cannot give advices regarding romance, but I shall protect you so that you do not become involved with a bad boy. This is about Ann, who has always been firmer than me, after all. Even if I do not do that, surely, if you are the one choosing, it will be a truly great person. Do not be afraid of love.</em></p>
<p>Even as she had turned 16.</p>
<p><em>Have you ridden in a car by now? Would you be surprised if Mom told you that I actually could ride in cars too? I used to drive a lot in the past. But I would be stopped by the people riding with me. They would go blue.</em></p>
<p><em>My gift for your birthday is a car of a color that suits you. Just use the enclosed key. But I wonder if it is now considered a classic model. Do not call it ‘lame’, okay? Mom is looking forward to you becoming able to see various different worlds.</em></p>
<p>Even as she had turned 18.</p>
<p><em>I wonder if you are married by now. What do I do? To become a wife at a young age is troublesome in many ways. But your child will definitely be cute, no matter if it is a boy or a girl. Mom guarantees that.</em></p>
<p><em>I do not mean to say precipitously that parenting is rough, but… the things you did that made me happy, the things you did that made me sad… I want you to raise your child with them in mind. It is all right. Regardless of how insecure you might become, I am here. I shall be by your side. Even as you become a mother, you are still my daughter, so it is fine to let out a screech sometimes. I love you.</em></p>
<p>Even as she had turned 20.</p>
<p><em>You have already lived 20 years now. Amazing! To think the little baby that was born from me would become so big! Life is truly whimsical. I am saddened that I could not see you grow into a pretty young woman. No, but I shall be watching over you from heaven.</em></p>
<p><em>Today, tomorrow, the day after; you will always remain a beauty, my Ann. Even if disagreeable people discourage you, I can affirm this with a puffed-out chest: you are gorgeous and the coolest young lady. Have confidence and move forward with full responsibility towards society.</em></p>
<p><em>You have managed to live this long because you have been taken care of by countless people. This is thanks to the structure of the community you are in. You have been helped out a lot without knowing. From now on, in order to pay back for it, please work even for my part.</em></p>
<p><em>I am kidding, sorry. You are a hard worker, so saying something like this is overdoing it. Have strength and enjoy life, my dearest. I love you.</em></p>
<p>The letters kept reaching her forever. The words her mother had written were recited in Ann’s mind by a voice that she would occasionally forget.</p>
<p>Back in the old days, the feelings of her sick mother had all been addressed to her. Each and every one of them were future birthday cards to her beloved daughter. Meaning that the one Ann had been jealous of was herself.</p>
<p>_“There is no such thing as a letter that needn’t be delivered, Young Mistress,” _Violet’s words echoed in Ann’s ears beyond the borders of time.</p>
<p>The letters continued finding their way to her, even as she married and had a child of her own. She – a woman of long, wavy black hair, who lived in an enormous peripheral mansion of her possession, located far from town – would make sure to go outside in the morning on a certain day of a certain month. She would wait while taking in the scenery that spread out before her.</p>
<p>As her ears picked the noise of the bike ridden by a postman clad in a green frock coat, she stood up with her eyes shining. Her figure as she anxiously waited while thinking, “Is it now? Is it now?” was certainly similar to that of her late mother.</p>
<p>The postman arrived at the residence, handing to her an enormous package with a smirk. He, who knew about the gifts sent to her every year, offered warm words of his own as well, “Congratulations for your birthday, Ma’am.”</p>
<p>She replied with slightly wet dark brown eyes, “Thank you.” And, at last, she asked what she had been wanting to for a long time, “Say, do you know Violet Evergarden?”</p>
<p>The post office and the ghostwriting industry had a close relationship. Once Ann inquired with her heart pounding “what-if”, the postman replied while grinning, “Yes, since she’s famous. She’s still active. Well, then…”</p>
<p>Ann watched as the postman took his leave, caressing the gift with a smile. Her tears slowly poured down. Still smiling, she whimpered a little.</p>
<p><em>——Ah… Mom, did you hear this just now?</em></p>
<p>That woman was still working as an Auto-Memories Doll. The person she had shared a part of her time with was still doing well, carrying on the same occupation.</p>
<p><em>——I’m happy. I’m really happy, Violet Evergarden.</em></p>
<p>From within the mansion, she could hear a call, “Mom!”</p>
<p>She turned to the direction of the voice. Someone waved from the window that she used to be at when observing her mother and Violet. It was a girl with slightly wavy hair that keenly resembled Ann herself.</p>
<p>“Another present from Grandma~?”</p>
<p>Ann nodded at her innocently smiling daughter. “Yes, it has arrived!” answering enthusiastically, Ann returned the wave.</p>
<p>Inside the house, her daughter and husband were about to commence her birthday party. She had to hurry back. Crying softly, she walked towards the mansion. As she did so, she was deep in thought.</p>
<p><em>——Hey, Mom. You said before that you wanted me to give my child all the happiness you’d once experienced, right? Those words… made me incredibly happy. They really resonated with me, is what I thought. That’s why I’ll do what you did. This isn’t an excuse to see that person, though. It’s part of the reason, but not all. I, too… have feelings that I want to convey. Even many years after our first meeting, I have a hunch that she definitely won’t have changed a thing. With her beautiful eyes and voice that has a sweet ring to it, she will write about my love for my own daughter. Violet Evergarden is that kind of woman – the one that does not disappoint. On the contrary, she was the type of Auto-Memories Doll that one would want to witness doing her work once more. When I see her again, I shall thank her and apologize to her without reserve. After all, I’m no longer that girl who could do nothing but cry.</em></p>
<p>Ann Magnolia would never forget the woman that had embraced her back when she was young.</p>
<hr>
<p><em>I… remember.</em></p>
<p><em>That she had come around.</em></p>
<p><em>That sitting there, quietly, she would write letters.</em></p>
<p><em>I… remember.</em></p>
<p><em>The figures of that person, and of my kindly smiling mother.</em></p>
<p><em>That sight… surely…</em></p>
<p><em>I would not forget even in death.</em></p>

<p><strong><em>Violet Evergarden</em></strong> written by Akatsuki Kana</p>
<p>From the author: I’m writing this letter from the north. Snow Country is a place as quiet as the dead of night. Because of the cold outside, I grew into an adult who <strong>indulges</strong> in movies and stories when at home. I hope that the scenes here, drawn from my imagination, might float with you on your sea of words.</p>
<p><strong>Prologue: “The Auto Memories Doll”</strong></p>
<p>Some time has passed since this term was all the rage. The first one was created by Dr. Orlando, the world’s authority on automatons. It all began when his wife Molly, a novelist, complained of her clouding vision. Molly, having devoted most of her life to her words, was <strong>crestfallen</strong> as they faded away from her. Once reduced to blindness, it seemed as if her strength also was wasting away. Dr. Orlando could not bear to see his dear wife this way, and as such he devised the Auto Memories Doll. It was a <strong>contraption</strong>capable of recording a person’s spoken words: a “borrowed pen,” as it were. At the time, the doctor had meant it merely a creation for his dearest, but the model quickly spread, and soon such dolls were acting to support <strong>myriad</strong> other people. Today Auto Memories Dolls are widely known, even available for rental at a modest price.</p>

<h1 id="C1P1"><a href="#C1P1" class="headerlink" title="[C1P1]"></a>[C1P1]</h1><p>The Novelist and the Doll, Part 1 <a href="https://nanodesutranslations.org/evergarden/1/1/" target="_blank" rel="external">⇖</a></p>
<p>Chapter 1: “The Novelist and the Doll”</p>
<p>Roswell was a city of green, <strong><u>ensconced</u></strong> in the beauty of nature. It bared itself among the foothills of tall mountains. Among those of ample resource, Roswell was known as a summer <strong><u>retreat</u></strong>; a town of villas and cottages, homes away from home.</p>
<p>In spring, the landscapes burst with flowers, bringing light to their admirers’ eyes. In summer, hikers there sought a moment of respite beside the city’s famed waterfall, well-loved for ages. In autumn, the rain of leaves softened the heart, and in winter the world itself was <strong><u>bestowed</u></strong> a mute <strong><u>tranquility</u></strong>. Each season’s flourish on stage was distinct; it was a land <strong><u>magnanimous</u></strong> upon the eyes of visitors at any time of year.</p>
<p>Vacation homes throughout the town formed a <strong><u>swatch</u></strong> of <strong><u>variegated</u></strong> wooden rooftops, both big and small. Land there was not cheap. Simply owning a home in Roswell was a sufficient sign of affluence.</p>
<p>In the city’s heart, countless shops courted one main throughway and catered to endless tourists. During holidays, this corridor was inevitably thronged with shoppers, and the people created a fabric of <strong><u>cacophony</u></strong> appropriate to city life, each weaving his happy <strong><u>bustle</u></strong> into the song of the street. The wares set out were nothing to <strong><u>scoff</u></strong> at–far from so, in fact, given the town’s remote location.</p>
<p>Most residents of Roswell sought convenience and so built their villas in the city proper. Those who settled elsewhere were the town eccentrics.</p>
<p>It was now autumn in Roswell. <strong><u>Cirrocumulus</u></strong> <strong><u>wafted</u></strong> in <strong><u>ripples</u></strong> high up in the sky. Far removed from the <strong><u>foothills</u></strong> was a small lake, an almost forgotten stop along the town’s busy tourist circuit. One small cottage stood quietly by its waters.</p>
<p>Viewed with kindness, it was a vintage home bearing a distinguished <strong><u>facade</u></strong>. To less forgiving eyes, the house was a monument to disrepair, long abandoned by human hands. One first had to pass under its arched gates, white now only by virtue of their long companionship with the sun. From there, a short path led through a garden buried in weeds and nameless flowers. Finally, at the path’s end, the home itself came into view.</p>
<p>The red brick walls were in such decay that one could only conclude the owner had no intent of ever patching them. Here and there a roof tile was split, once-orderly ranks now cruelly dismembered.</p>
<p>Immediately next to the entrance, vines had coiled themselves in knots about a swing, ensuring that it would swing no more. It was both evidence of a child and evidence that the child was certainly here no longer.</p>
<p>The owner of the house was a man in the prime of life. His name was Oscar.</p>
<p>He was a screenwriter working without <strong><u>pretense</u></strong> of <strong><u>nom de plume</u></strong>. His hair was red with a curl, and his black-rimmed glasses could hardly contain the thick lenses with which they had been charged. Oscar’s back was slightly <strong><u>hunched</u></strong>, but his face was fresh, lending him an air of youthfulness belying his real age. Sensitive to the cold, he was never without a sweater. All in all, Oscar was an unremarkable man, hardly seeming fit to be the hero of any story.</p>
<p>To Oscar, this house was not a villa. Quite simply, Roswell was home, and it was in this house that Oscar lived.</p>
<p>It was built to house not him alone, but also his wife and young daughter. The rooms had been quite spacious for three, but now they were used by only one. Oscar lived alone. Both his wife and child had already departed for the other world.</p>
<p>The wife had <strong><u>succumbed</u></strong> to an illness with a name so <strong><u>meandering</u></strong> it was hard to even remember.</p>
<p>To put it simply, her blood had <strong><u>coagulated</u></strong> in her veins, blocking them. Death quickly followed. The condition was genetic. Her father, too, had suffered that fate.</p>
<p>Oscar had known his wife was an orphan. He’d heard her <strong><u>plaintive</u></strong> story of the many from her family who had died young. But it was not until after she died that he grasped the true reason for this.</p>
<p>At the funeral, her close friend had <strong><u>confided</u></strong> in Oscar. “She was frightened. She thought if it were known, no one would ever want to marry her. So she kept it hidden.” When the words hit Oscar’s ears, only one thought echoed through his mind: “Why?”</p>
<p>“Why? Why? Why?”</p>
<p><em>All you had to do was say it. You could have shared anything with me.</em></p>
<p><em>There’s so much we could have done. We could have searched together for a cure. We had all this useless excess of money to throw at it.</em></p>
<p>It was clear that Oscar’s wife had not married him for his money. They’d met before his break as a screenwriter. She was a librarian at the library he frequented. And in any case, it was Oscar himself who first began to stare.</p>
<p><em>How pretty</em>, he’d thought.</p>
<p><em>And she’s the one in charge of the new arrivals corner. It always has such good books.</em></p>
<p>As he fell in love with her books, so too did he fall in love with her.</p>
<p>“Why?” The question echoed some hundred million times. It buaround his mind, then finally vanished.</p>
<p>His wife’s friend was an accomplished woman. While Oscar’s heart <strong><u>floundered</u></strong> in the wake of loss, she worked vigorously to attend to the young daughter who had been left in Oscar’s care. Left to himself, the man would go all day without eating, so she brought warm food to their home. The girl, in turn, sobbed for her missing mother, so with her she sat, gently tying the girl’s hair in braids as her mother used to do.</p>
<p>Perhaps, for a brief moment, there had been a spark of love between Oscar and this woman. Late one night, when Oscar’s daughter had been sick in bed with a fever and had suddenly begun to <strong><u>vomit</u></strong> uncontrollably, it was she who rushed the girl to the hospital. And it was she, not Oscar, who first learned that the girl was <strong><u>afflicted</u></strong> with the same <strong><u>ailment</u></strong>.</p>
<p>From there, the disease progressed gradually. But for Oscar, it was all much too fast.</p>
<hr>
<h1 id="C1P2"><a href="#C1P2" class="headerlink" title="[C1P2]"></a>[C1P2]</h1><p>Desperate to avoid a repeat of their recent tragedy, Oscar turned to the finest physicians from across the land. They moved from one great hospital to the next. Oscar implored each doctor they met, and through his appeals learned of a new, experimental treatment. The decision seemed an easy one.</p>
<p>Yet every herb has its <strong>demons</strong>. The girl <strong>clamored</strong> with each swallow, a sight which ate away at her <strong>doting</strong> father as the days of treatment stretched on.</p>
<p>The new treatment seemed to have no effect on her symptoms. Having no further recourse, the doctors declared it a lost cause and withdrew from the fight.</p>
<p>Oscar became <strong>plagued</strong> with the <strong>absurd</strong> notion that his lonely wife was <strong>beckon</strong>ing to their daughter from the world beyond. He <strong>wailed</strong> at her grave, “Don’t take her from me!” But the dead speak no words.</p>
<p>Oscar was <strong>teetering</strong> on the edge. Perhaps unexpectedly, it was his wife’s friend who broke first. Exhausted by endless <strong>fret</strong>ting as the girl <strong>hung in limbo</strong>, she appeared less and less often at the hospital, then finally stopped coming altogether. Oscar and his daughter were now truly alone. The girl’s extensive medication had left her <strong>emaciated</strong>. Her once-milky skin was a sickly yellow and her once-rosy cheeks <strong>pallid</strong>.</p>
<p>Her honeyed hair, too, was now falling out.</p>
<p>Oscar could no longer bear to look at her.</p>
<p>After endlessly pushing fruitless questions upon the doctors, he finally <strong>relent</strong>ed. The girl would continue on <strong>analgesics</strong> alone. All other treatment would stop. Oscar resolved that if nothing else, his daughter’s short life would not end in suffering.</p>
<p>The next while was peaceful. They spent happy days together. He saw his daughter smile for the first time in months. So continued their last few days of light.</p>
<p>It was glorious autumn outside on the day that she died. Color was slipping from the world drip by drip, but the sky was bright blue and cloudless. From the window, one caught <strong>candid</strong> glimpses of trees dressed in reds and yellows. A fountain stood in the hospital grounds, offering <strong>respite</strong> to the <strong>weary</strong>. Fallen leaves floated soundlessly across its pool.</p>
<p>Each leaf there had fallen to the water’s surface and <strong>drifted</strong> there until finally pulled into a <strong>clump</strong> of <strong>comrade</strong>s. Now they floated aimlessly together. New leaves were always pulled in, almost as if by magnet. Thus, even in their <strong>wreckage</strong>, lives lost to the season, they emerged in beautiful <strong>synchronization</strong>.</p>
<p>On seeing them, the girl spoke. “How pretty.</p>
<p>“The way the water’s blue and the color of the leaves mix together. It’s so pretty. Father, if a person stepped on those leaves, do you think they’d walk across the pond without falling in?”</p>
<p>Ah, the innocence of a child. Surely gravity and weight would conspire to bring one’s body plunging in, but Oscar could deny his daughter no more.</p>
<p>“And if you held an umbrella, my sweet, you could use the wind and perhaps even float just above it.”</p>
<p>His tone was playful. He longed so badly to dote on his helpless daughter just a little more. And as she listened to his words, her eyes sparkled. “Yes. Yes, that’s just what I’ll do. I’ll dance across the water for you.”</p>
<p><em>Someday I’ll dance for you. On the lake, by our home now far away. When the leaves drift across the water in autumn.</em></p>
<p>Shortly after, she fell into a coughing fit. One cough, two, then several more. And then, as if stolen away, she was gone.</p>
<p>She had been but nine years old.</p>
<p>When Oscar brought his arms under the <strong>husk</strong> she had left behind, it felt dreadfully light. Too light, even for a body now short a soul.</p>
<p>Had she ever even been alive? Had it just been one long dream? Tears came to his eyes.</p>
<p>The girl was buried alongside her mother. Oscar returned to the house built for three, and there he began his life of silence.</p>
<p>Oscar had financial means enough to live on without working. A royalty system brought in money each time his widely-used scripts were employed. He would never <strong>scrape</strong> the bottom of his savings, and he would never go hungry.</p>
<p>After several years of mourning for his wife and daughter, a long-lost work acquaintance reached out to Oscar. Wouldn’t he try his hand at one more script?</p>
<p>It was <strong>at the behest of</strong> an elite performing <strong>troupe</strong>, one which any actor would clamor to be a part of. For Oscar, whose past work was known but who had all but vanished from the industry, it was an honor simply to be asked.</p>
<p>He’d spent so many days <strong>languishing</strong> in <strong>sloth</strong>, <strong>wallowing</strong> in sadness, <strong>indulging</strong> in self-pity.</p>
<p>Man is a thing that tires. Whether happiness or sadness, he cannot bear to live always with that alone. That is how he is built.</p>
<p>Oscar agreed to the job in his second reply, determined to lift his pen once more.</p>
<p>But here the trouble began. In desperation to escape his <strong>harsh</strong> reality, Oscar had turned to–no, embraced–the bottle. And with it came a <strong>smattering</strong> of drugs to ensure happy thoughts at least in dreams. With the help of his doctor he had somehow managed to conquer the drink and drugs themselves, yet in their wake, his hands were left forever trembling.</p>
<p>Whether words laid on paper or struck with keys, his efforts to push forward seemed hopeless.</p>
<p>His breast was full with words; he merely needed to find the way to bring them forth.</p>
<p>He turned once more to his acquaintance to ask for advice.</p>
<p>“I’ve just the thing.</p>
<p>“We need to get you an Auto Memories Doll.”</p>
<p>“What’s that?”</p>
<p>“Ah, my friend, you’ve been away from the world too long… I’m worried about you. Auto Memories Dolls. Everybody knows about them. You can even rent them out. Hardly costs a thing anymore. Yes, that’s what we’ll do. I’ll have one sent over for you to try out.”</p>
<p>“I’m going to get help from a… doll?”</p>
<p>“Hah! A special kind of doll, to be sure.”</p>
<p>And that was how Oscar came to use a new kind of tool, one whose name he’d only just learned. Oscar and the “Auto Memories Doll.” This was the beginning of their fates <strong>entwined</strong>.</p>
<hr>
<h1 id="C1P3"><a href="#C1P3" class="headerlink" title="[C1P3]"></a>[C1P3]</h1><p>A woman made her way up the mountain path.</p>
<p>Her bangs hung freely. <strong><u>Braids</u></strong> laced the crown of her head, held together with a ribbon of deep, <strong><u>velvety</u></strong> red. Her slender frame was wrapped in a snowy white summer dress tied at the waist.</p>
<p>The dress’ silk, <strong><u>pleated</u></strong> skirt <strong><u>fluttered</u></strong> <strong><u>angelically</u></strong> with each step she took. The <u>emerald</u> <strong><u>brooch</u></strong> <strong><u>affix</u></strong>ed at her <strong><u>bosom</u></strong>&lt;/u&gt; <u><strong>sparkled</strong></u>.</p>
<p>Over the dress, she wore a <strong><u>sleek</u></strong>, Prussian blue jacket. Her long boots had deepened into a cocoa brown with age. And on this day, as she passed under the white arch of Oscar’s home, she held in her hand a heavy-looking <strong><u>trunk</u></strong>.</p>
<p>Just as the woman stepped into the front garden, a <strong><u>gust</u></strong> of autumn wind <strong><u>bellowed</u></strong>, bringing red, yellow, and brown leaves <strong><u>swirling</u></strong> about her in dancing rings. Her vision seemed to <strong><u>falter</u></strong>, as if these swirling <strong><u>remnants</u></strong> of autumn had pulled a curtain down before her. She reached a hand to the brooch affixed at her breast, squeezed it tight, and <strong><u>intoned</u></strong> in a low voice some words that were <strong><u>eclipse</u></strong>d by those wings of autumn as they continued to flutter excitedly. Having reached no ears, the spoken words melted away into space.</p>
<p>When the <strong><u>mischievous</u></strong> wind died down, the woman seemed to set aside her recent display of uncertainty. She continued on to the entryway with purpose. There she pressed on the buzzer with one finger of a hand <strong><u>encased</u></strong> in black glove.</p>
<p>The house’s bell <strong><u>reverberated</u></strong> like a screech escaped from hell. A moment later, the door opened. The house’s red-haired owner <strong><u>peer</u></strong>ed out from the gap. It was hard to tell whether he’d just woken up or whether he’d not slept at all. In either case, he was clearly in no state to be receiving guests. His clothing and face were both <strong><u>disheveled</u></strong>. On seeing the woman, Oscar let slip a slight look of surprise. He seemed to have <strong><u>been taken aback</u></strong> by the woman’s most <strong><u>peculiar</u></strong> appearance.</p>
<p>Or perhaps he had been caught off guard by her singular beauty. Whatever the case, he found himself, for a moment, short of breath.</p>
<p>“You’re… the ‘Auto Memories Doll’?”</p>
<p>“That is correct. Please inform me of any assistance you might require, and I will be happy to oblige. Auto Memories Doll Violet Evergarden, at your service.”</p>
<p>The storybook blonde-haired, blue-eyed beauty spoke these words with no trace of <strong><u>obsequiousness</u></strong>. Rather, they <strong><u>emanated</u></strong> from her lips with the deep clarity of a well-polished gemstone.</p>
<p>The woman who had identified herself as Violet Evergarden carried herself in quiet beauty, the very <strong>essence</strong> of a doll. Her blue eyes, <u>lace</u>d by eyelashes of golden thread, sparkled with the mysteries of the seabed. From the milk-white skin of her cheek blushed the <strong><u>splendor</u></strong> of cherry petals at their peak. Her <strong><u>rouge-tinted lips</u></strong> <strong><u>glistened</u></strong> invitingly.</p>
<p>Nothing about her was lacking. <u>Her beauty was as full as the moon at its peak.</u></p>
<p>Had she not blinked, one would have thought she was a static work of art.</p>
<p>Oscar knew nothing about Auto Memories Dolls. The arrangements for Violet’s arrival had been handled entirely by the same friend who had convinced Oscar to take on this new writing job.</p>
<p>“It’ll be delivered in a few days,” he’d said.</p>
<p>And here she was at last.</p>
<p>From the way his friend spoke, Oscar had assumed some small package would arrive at his door, care of the postman. He’d open up the box and inside would be a small, mechanical doll. He was hardly prepared for this thing so lifelike, this… <strong><u>automaton</u></strong>.</p>
<p><em>How far has civilization progressed while I’ve <u>holed myself up</u> here?</em></p>
<p>Oscar had never shown particular interest in any of the ways of the world. He read no newspapers or magazines, and he rarely socialized. If it weren’t for the friends who showed concern for him, perhaps his only interaction would have been with the deliveryman from the grocer’s.</p>
<p>Already Oscar was regretting his hasty decision. Clearly he should have spent more time looking into the matter of the doll before giving his consent. The mere thought of having another person in the house meant only for that long-lost family of three did not sit well with him. It was like an unpleasant aftertaste. Another person… or something that resembled one, anyway.</p>
<p>Oscar felt as if he were somehow betraying his family.</p>
<p>Violet, perfectly unaware of any of these thoughts <u>swirling</u> about Oscar’s head, followed him into the living room and set herself down on the sofa when invited. When Oscar offered her tea, she drank it. These modern automatons seemed to be quite advanced.</p>
<p>“What happens to the tea after you drink it?”</p>
<p>Sensing Oscar’s tone of disbelief, Violet gently tipped her head to one side as she answered. “Ultimately it is discharged from my body, after which I believe it returns to the Earth.”</p>
<p>An answer befitting of a machine.</p>
<p>“To tell the truth… I’m at a bit of a loss right now. You’re a bit… different from what I expected.”</p>
<p>Violet glanced down as if to confirm her own appearance, then abruptly stood up from the sofa and returned Oscar’s stare.</p>
<p>“Is there something about me which does not meet your expectations?”</p>
<p>“Uh… well, it’s not exactly my expectations…”</p>
<p>“If the additional wait would not inconvenience you, I can arrange for the <strong><u>dispatch</u></strong> of a different doll, one more suitable to your needs.”</p>
<p>“Ah, no… that’s not what I’m trying to say. Uh, well… let’s just try this out, I suppose. If you can do the work, that’s all that matters. You seem un<strong><u>obtrusive</u></strong> enough.”</p>
<p>“If it pleases you, I will restrict my respiration to the minimally required level.”</p>
<p>“Ah, no, that won’t be necessary.”</p>
<hr>
<h1 id="C1P4"><a href="#C1P4" class="headerlink" title="[C1P4]"></a>[C1P4]</h1><p>“I have been dispatched here to fulfill your need for a scribe. I will perform my duties to your utmost satisfaction so as to not sully the Auto Memories Doll name. It matters not whether my tools are pen and paper or typewriter. Please make use of me as planned.”</p>
<p>Violet uttered these words with her large, jewel-like eyes affixed firmly on Oscar’s. It made Oscar feel a bit <strong>fidgety</strong>, but he managed to answer with an awkward nod.</p>
<p>The doll had been requested for a period of two weeks. They had only that much time to complete one full script.</p>
<p>Oscar composed himself and led Violet into his study, intending to begin work immediately.</p>
<p>However, on arrival there, it became clear that Violet’s first duties would not be as a scribe but as a housekeeper.</p>
<p>Oscar had pulled everything necessary into one room for it to double as both an office and a bedroom. <strong>Strewn</strong> about the floor were dirtied clothes and dishes filled with half-eaten meals. It was a miserable <strong>spectacle</strong>. Such was the mess that one could hardly find space to walk across the floor.</p>
<p>Violet remained silent as she again trained her blue eyes upon Oscar. The eyes themselves seemed to accuse. <em>Did you do anything at all to prepare for my arrival?</em></p>
<p>“…I’m sorry.”</p>
<p>Oscar himself knew that it was not a room befitting a working man. Since beginning his days alone, Oscar had hardly touched the living room. As a result, that room had remained in quite a <strong>presentable</strong> state. But the <strong>well-trodden</strong> rooms of his house–this office, the washroom, and the bathroom–had all fallen into a most <strong>wretched</strong> state.</p>
<p>He suddenly felt quite grateful that Violet was an automaton.</p>
<p>Her physical appearance suggested a young woman at the twilight of her teens, or perhaps in her early twenties. Oscar could think of any number of other torturous things he would prefer to endure than the situation of having to show a real girl of that age this embarrassment of an office. It was un<strong>chivalrous</strong>, and Oscar’s advancing years were no excuse.</p>
<p>“Sir, I must respectfully remind you that I am here to act as a scribe, not as a maid.”</p>
<p>Yet even as she spoke, Violet pulled from her trunk a white, frilled apron and began cleaning the room with a certain zeal. Thus passed their first day.</p>
<p>On the second, they finally managed to both seat themselves in the office and set about the real work ahead.</p>
<p>To be more precise, Oscar reclined on the bed, and Violet sat in the office’s lone chair. She rested her hands on the typewriter stationed at the desk.</p>
<p>“She spoke–”</p>
<p>As Oscar began to dictate his story, Violet’s hands moved over the keys with a flurry of speed. Her strokes were yet quiet, and of course performed perfectly from memory. Oscar’s eyes grew wide with surprise.</p>
<p>“You’re quite… fast, aren’t you?”</p>
<p>On receiving the compliment, Violet rolled up her sleeve and removed the black glove from one hand. She held the exposed arm up for Oscar to see. It ticked and whirred. A completely mechanical arm. The fingers and knuckles were of especially sturdy construction, finished with only a rudimentary coat of paint. “My parts have been chosen for maximum utility while still simulating human form. These were produced by Estark. They are renowned for their durability. They also boast a range of movement and compressive strength far exceeding that of human hands. They will suffice in allowing me to record your words precisely as you dictate.”</p>
<p>“Is that so… Uh, well, you don’t need to write down what I’m saying now. Just the words in the script.”</p>
<p>Oscar resumed his dictation. They took several breaks, but for the first day of writing, it seemed to go quite well.</p>
<p>Of course, he’d already had the play structured out somewhere in his mind. So far it had seemed quite easy to find the words.</p>
<p>And as he spoke, Oscar realized that Violet was a superb <strong>conduit</strong> and scribe. From the beginning, he’d noted her quiet appearance, and as they began to work she was every bit faithful to this impression. Though he hadn’t gone so far to ask it of her, he found that he really could not hear the sound of her breathing. The only sound at all in the room, besides Oscar’s own voice, was the click, clack of the typewriter. If he closed his eyes, it almost seemed as if he were pushing the keys himself. When he asked her to read back passages to check his progress, her voice was clear and perfectly <strong>inflected</strong>. Just listening to it was a joy.</p>
<p>Through her voice, every passage seemed a <strong>majestic</strong> tale.</p>
<p><em>So this is what has made them so popular.</em></p>
<p>He finally seemed to gain a deep appreciation for the qualities of the Auto Memories Doll.</p>
<p>But Oscar and Violet’s smooth progress halted abruptly on the fourth day. Several days passed without so much as a word written. Oscar was <strong>plagued</strong> with the writer’s most common <strong>affliction</strong>. Though the story seemed clear to him, the words would not spin together into the fabric they were meant to be.</p>
<p>Long years of experience had taught Oscar what he must do in this situation. The answer was simple: stop writing. He was of the firm belief that no great writing was born when forced.</p>
<p>He regretted having to make Violet wait.</p>
<p>Violet, for her part, quickly and seriously complied with requests for any other type of work around the house, from cleaning to cooking. She seemed to have been designed with, first and <strong>foremost</strong>, a hardworking disposition. It had been quite some time since Oscar had eaten a home-cooked meal, still <strong>wafting up steam</strong> on service. He’d had many a meal delivered and occasionally even went out to eat, but such foods somehow paled in comparison with a simple meal prepared through the labors of a well-meaning novice.</p>
<p>He ate unusual <strong>omelets</strong> whose every bite melted in his mouth. He ate a <strong>patty</strong> of hamburger mixed with tofu, presented on serving as “an exotic recipe carried from lands far to the East.” He ate fine <strong>pilafs</strong> of rice mixed with <strong>tangy</strong> sauces and flourishes of colorful vegetables. He ate seafood <strong>au gratin</strong>, a rare gem in this mountainous land. Violet inevitably balanced the meal with some sort of salad or soup on the side. Oscar was quite <strong>awed</strong> by it all.</p>
<hr>
<h1 id="C1P5"><a href="#C1P5" class="headerlink" title="[C1P5]"></a>[C1P5]</h1><p>At every meal, she gazed at him quietly and did not say a word.</p>
<p>Even when he invited her to join him, she politely, yet firmly, refused. “Thank you, but I will take my own meal afterward.” He had seen her consume liquid that first day, but he had yet to see her eat solid food. Perhaps that was beyond her scope. He briefly fancied her <strong><u>guzzling down</u></strong> mineral oil during those meals she insisted taking in strict privacy. The thought of it spawned a series of surreal images in his mind.</p>
<p><em>There’s really no need to exercise all this restraint. I wish you’d just sit down and have a meal together with me.</em></p>
<p>Oscar <strong><u>mulled the words</u></strong> over in his mind but could never quite bring them to voice. Violet was nothing like his late wife. Yet Oscar often found himself watching the back of her slender frame as she worked in the kitchen, and when he did, he was filled with a strange sense of familiarity. If he stared too long, he’d be struck by an excess of <strong><u>melancholy</u></strong>, and tears would <strong><u>inexplicably</u></strong> <u>well</u> in his eyes. This addition of a new person in Oscar’s world had led him to quite an unexpected realization.</p>
<p><em>I’ve been leading an ever-so-lonely life.</em></p>
<p>The <strong><u>elation</u></strong> of meeting Violet at the doorway when she returned from some <strong><u>errand</u></strong>… The secure feeling that he was not alone in that house when he went to bed at night… The reality that Violet was there, always there, whenever he opened his eyes… All these things impressed upon him the extent of his previous isolation.</p>
<p>He had his money, and he found nothing wanting in his lifestyle. But in truth, his comforts brought no sense of enrichment. In fact, they were hardly more than a thin, final sheet trying vainly to guard his <strong><u>downtrodden</u></strong> heart against any more abuse.</p>
<p>Certainly, they were doing nothing to heal those wounds.</p>
<p>Someone was there, and that someone–even if not a person with whom he was yet particularly close–was waking up in the morning in just the same place and at just the same time as he was.</p>
<p>Such thoughts pierced the heart Oscar had kept tightly closed for so long.</p>
<p>Violet was a <strong><u>ripple</u></strong> upon Oscar’s <strong><u>stagnant</u></strong> life. She brought no <strong><u>strife</u></strong>, but her very presence was a slight change to the waters of his lake. A cold, lifeless stone had struck the surface, and somehow it had brought a warm current to his <strong><u>monotony</u></strong>, to his <strong><u>sluggish</u></strong> pool. He <strong><u>feign</u></strong>ed not knowing whether this change was good or bad. But if pressed, he just might have been ready to admit the likelihood of it being for the better.</p>
<p>At the very least, the melancholy <strong><u>unearth</u></strong>ed by Violet’s presence and the tears it <strong><u>wrought</u></strong> were somehow warmer than the feelings and tears he had <u>bled</u> before.</p>
<p>When there were only three days left with Violet, Oscar finally lifted himself out of idleness. One certain scene had been responsible for this long stewing.</p>
<p>Oscar had charged Violet with a tale of adventure and mystery. At its head was a young, lone heroine. Her travels far and wide were filled with faces and encounters of every type. And over the course of her journey, she became something more than she had been before.</p>
<p>The template for this heroine was Oscar’s late daughter. At the end of the tale, she returned to the home she had left so long ago. And at that home, her elderly father sat waiting. Yet when the heroine appeared, now a splendid young woman so far beyond the little girl of the past, not even her own father could recognize her.</p>
<p>With tear-stained cheeks, the heroine would <strong><u>plead</u></strong> with her father. “Don’t you remember?” And here she would repeat the promise she had made to him so long ago: the promise to dance across the fallen leaves strewn across the surface of their lake.</p>
<p>“It is quite impossible for a human to walk across water.”</p>
<p>“I need a visual to work with. Please. In the story, she’ll be able to do it because of help from the water spirit–the one whose protection she received during the journey.”</p>
<p>“Even if that’s the case… I’m hardly suitable for this sort of thing. The girl of the story is lighthearted and charming. She’s sweetly innocent. She’s in complete contrast to me.”</p>
<p>The novelist and the Auto Memories Doll had come to a head.</p>
<p>It was all because of a request made by Oscar. He’d asked Violet to dress up like the heroine and to <u>splash</u> around in the water along the lakeshore next to his cottage. He’d already asked her to clean his house, to do his laundry, to take care of all his household chores. And now came this. It was as if he expected her to be outfitted for anything.</p>
<p>Violet, who had until now played the part of the cool-headed working woman, had finally reached her limit. “You’re simply impossible.”</p>
<p>“Your hair, it’s almost the same blonde as my daughter’s. If you were to let it down and to put on a summer dress, then it’d be just…”</p>
<p>“Sir… my purpose, first and foremost, is to serve as a scribe. I am an Auto Memories Doll. I am neither your wife nor your mistress. I am not capable of acting as a substitute for anyone else.”</p>
<p>“I, I know that. I’m not about to get any undue ideas about a young thing like you. It’s just that your… the way you look… I mean, if my daughter were still alive, she’d be just about your height, and… I’d just thought…”</p>
<p>Violet, who had up to that point rejected the very idea earnestly, suddenly faltered. Her expression wavered visibly.</p>
<p>“…I had assumed this was an expression of your <strong><u>peculiar</u></strong>… tastes. I had not realized you’d lost a daughter.”</p>
<p>Violet chewed her lip. Her face betrayed a struggle of conscience.</p>
<p>Over these past few days, Oscar had realized something about Violet. In the battle of good and evil, she clearly stood on the side of good.</p>
<p>“I am an Auto Memories Doll… I exist to execute the desires of my clients… yet I feel as if this request is in conflict with my professional <strong><u>decorum</u></strong>…”</p>
<p>Watching her mumble the pros and cons over by herself, Oscar felt a <strong><u>twinge</u></strong> of regret, yet he decided to try one final push.</p>
<hr>
<h1 id="C1P6"><a href="#C1P6" class="headerlink" title="[C1P6]"></a>[C1P6]</h1><p>“If I can just see that scene, of the daughter all grown up, coming home to fulfill her promise, I know I’ll be able to finally write it. I’m sure of it. I’ll be happy to make it up to you in any way I can. I’ll pay twice your original fee. This story is everything to me. If I can just write it, it’ll be a new beginning for me. A turning point in life. Please.”</p>
<p>“But… I am most certainly not a… dress-up toy.”</p>
<p>“If that’s how you feel, I’ll promise you right here: No pictures.”</p>
<p>“You had intended to take pictures?!”</p>
<p>“OK! No pictures! I’ll burn the image into my brain and use it to write the story. Violet, please.”</p>
<p>For some moments afterward, Violet stood with a <strong><u>scrunched</u></strong> face and continued to mull the idea over, but in the end, she was beaten out by Oscar’s <strong><u>tenacity</u></strong>. One might have suspected she was of the type easily pressured into things.</p>
<p>Oscar, so excited by their new understanding, broke his long <strong><u>reclusion</u></strong> by heading out to town to purchase fine clothes and an umbrella for Violet.</p>
<p>He brought back a two-tone dress of white lace on top and blue on bottom, with a ribbon-belted waist. The umbrella was sky blue with white stripes, its <strong><u>canopy</u></strong> edged in <strong>frills</strong>. Violet seemed particularly pleased with the umbrella, and after he handed it to her she snapped it open and closed, open and closed, then <u><strong>twirled</strong></u> it around in her hands.</p>
<p>“Haven’t you ever had an umbrella before?”</p>
<p>“I have. But I had not known of ones as delightful as this.”</p>
<p>“Is that so? You’re always dressed in such charming outfits. I’d thought following fashion was a hobby of yours.”</p>
<p>“I merely dress according to the recommendations set forth by my superiors at the agency. I do not frequent dressmakers’ or other such shops myself.”</p>
<p>It was as if she were a child dressed up in clothing chosen by her mother. A new thought struck Oscar. <em>Perhaps she’s really much younger than I’d guessed</em>. And suddenly Violet seemed to Oscar a fraction less a woman and a tad more a child.</p>
<p>Now finished shopping, Oscar hurriedly motioned for Violet to change her clothes–before she could change her mind.</p>
<p>It was early afternoon. The sky was mildly <strong><u>overcast</u></strong>. Rain seemed unlikely, yet its perfume hung in the air. A chill wind danced about, <strong><u>herald</u></strong>ing autumn, but not yet harsh enough to <strong><u>sting</u></strong>.</p>
<p>Oscar had already gone outside to wait. He sat down in a wooden chair he’d carried right up to the side of the lake and began smoking a pipe.</p>
<p>Since Violet’s arrival, he’d refrained from smoking out of a vague sense of consideration. Now, after that long fast, the smoke seemed to <strong><u>permeate</u></strong> all the way down to his belly. Several minutes had passed of him blowing rings that hung lazily in the air when came the plaintive screech of the drooping, unoiled front door.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry to have kept you.”</p>
<p>He twisted his neck to meet her exquisite voice.</p>
<p>“No…”</p>
<p>–<em>trouble at all, my dear</em>, he’d meant to say, but his breath had taken flight, leaving him alone with his words.</p>
<p>With those unspoken words still caught in his throat, Oscar stared in <strong><u>awe</u></strong> at Violet. It was like he was seeing her for the first time all over again. With her hair let down, she had enough charm to steal time away from any eyes placed upon her. Her braided hair flowed gently down across her frame in a gentle curve. It was much longer than he’d thought. But, more than that–</p>
<p><em>If she’d lived to this age, this is just how she’d look.</em></p>
<p>He thought of all those years he should have been able to spend watching his daughter dressing up, playing pretend, and a burning feeling welled up from his chest.</p>
<p>“Are you satisfied with the appearance of the clothing you selected for me?”</p>
<p>She <strong><u>clutched</u></strong> the <strong><u>hem</u></strong> of her skirt in one hand and spun in place. It was as if she had floated down into this world of autumn colors from another realm. Such was the beauty of this <strong>divine-faced</strong> young woman.</p>
<p>“If it pleases you, I will proceed to the lake so you may begin your observations… That is what you had in mind, correct? For the scene you would like to compose? Rather than simply have me walk around in this outfit, it would be preferable for you to see me on the surface of the water, if only for a few seconds. Sir, leave everything to me. My mobility is of the highest <strong><u>caliber</u></strong>. I can provide you with the scene you require, if only briefly.”</p>
<p>Oscar, busy with half a dozen <strong>tugging</strong> emotions, simply nodded and gave faint murmurs of consent during all this <strong><u>discourse</u></strong>. Violet paid his condition no mind, delivering her words with her usual cool, matter-of-fact tone.</p>
<p>The young woman before Oscar was someone quite different from his daughter. Though she had the same golden locks, there was no sweet sparkle in her eyes.</p>
<p>Violet’s umbrella was closed. She <strong>grip</strong>ped it firmly in one hand and leveled it on her shoulder, then stood back and stared out across the water as if making careful calculations.</p>
<p><u>The glory of autumn had <strong>withered</strong> and fallen</u>, its traces <strong><u>scatter</u></strong>ed about the surface of the lake. The wind came in short, <strong><u>erratic</u></strong> bursts, now blowing, now quiet. Violet wet one mechanical finger with the tip of her tongue and held it up to test the wind’s direction. Oscar watched her <strong>fretfully</strong>.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Violet tensed. Her feet dug firmly into the ground with a <strong><u>crunch</u></strong>, and she turned to face Oscar bearing the slightest trace of a smile.</p>
<p>“Worry not. I’ll see to it that everything goes precisely as you have hoped.”</p>
<hr>
<h1 id="C1P7"><a href="#C1P7" class="headerlink" title="[C1P7]"></a>[C1P7]</h1><p>As the last of those words rang clearly through the air, Violet began to move forward. There had been quite some distance between her and the lake, but in the blink of an eye, she had already passed before Oscar’s. She seemed to quite literally be moving as fast as the wind.</p>
<p>At her final step before meeting the lake’s edge, the fleet-footed Auto Memories Doll kicked off with great force, <strong><u>gouging</u></strong> out marks in the earth where she had made this final escape from land. Her powerful legs lifted her unbelievably high into the air, and for a moment, it seemed as if she might just continue on her way up the stairway to heaven. Oscar’s mouth fell open as he observed her <strong><u>unworldly</u></strong> movements. Everything seemed to be happening in slow motion.</p>
<p>On reaching the peak of her great leap, Violet raised her hand and the umbrella it had been holding high above her head. The <strong><u>canopy</u></strong> sprang open suddenly, like a flower blooming in the sky. The frills along its edge wavered <strong><u>enchantingly</u></strong>.</p>
<p>As if on cue, the wind picked up again and swept Violet and her umbrella across the sky.</p>
<p>The umbrella –and Violet’s skirt– <strong><u>billow</u></strong>ed gently while drifting downward. Here and there were flashes of white <strong><u>petticoat</u></strong>. At long last, the tip of Violet’s personal, <strong><u>meticulously</u></strong> kept lace-up boot touched gently against one leaf floating on the water.</p>
<p>That moment. That instant. That single frame. The clear image burned into Oscar’s <strong><u>retinae</u></strong> with such precision it was as if he’d snapped a photograph after all. The arc of the umbrella, the fluttering of the skirt, the girl with her foot arched against the face of the lake. It was the work of a <strong><u>sorceress</u></strong>. To Oscar’s mind came the fateful day which had stopped his daughter’s heart, and the words his daughter had spoken to him then:</p>
<p>“Someday.”</p>
<p><em>Someday I’ll dance for you. On the lake, by our home now far away. When the leaves <strong>drift</strong> across the water in autumn.</em></p>
<p>“Someday.”</p>
<p><em>Someday I’ll dance for you.</em></p>
<p>“Father.”</p>
<p>That voice. Her voice. He thought he’d lost it long ago, but there it was, echoing through his mind. <em>You never knew it, but I’d wanted so badly to hear you call out to me. Another thousand times wouldn’t have been enough.</em></p>
<p>“Someday I’ll dance for you.”</p>
<p><em>“Father,” you’d say.</em></p>
<p><em>In that sweet, frail voice.</em></p>
<p>“Someday I’ll dance for you, Father.”</p>
<p><em>Your voice was more soothing to my ears than any music.</em></p>
<p>“Someday I’ll dance for you.”</p>
<p><em>Yes, that’s just how it was. Just like that. With that voice. Trying in perfect innocence to bring a smile to my face. That’s how you said it.</em></p>
<p><em>I’d forgotten your promise. I’d forgotten all about it. It’s been a long time–so very, very long–since I’ve been able to remember you. I’m so happy to see you again. To see you again… even if only as a dream. My darling. My daughter. My… My… …My one and only treasure, shared between my love and me.</em></p>
<p><em>You must have known that you could never keep it. And yet you made your promise to me. That promise… your death… it <strong><u>withered</u></strong> me away into what I am now, and yet it let me live on. It stretched my life out this far. I <strong><u>stumbled</u></strong> onward, searching for a trace of you. And though I did so always full of regret, I have been granted this one instant. It is not you. But in that one instant, for me, she was you.</em></p>
<p><em>One fleeting moment of <strong><u>serendipity</u></strong>, of reunion, of embrace. I’d wanted so badly to see this moment. Perhaps that is what kept me alive.</em></p>
<p><em>You, whose name I had not even been able to <strong><u>mournfully</u></strong> whisper. I’d waited so long to see you. One more time, my darling. The last family left to me. Oh, how I’d waited. So long I had missed you. I loved you.</em></p>
<p>Heavy with joy, he wanted to smile.</p>
<p>“…Ohh… Ohh…” Only sobs escaped his lips.</p>
<p>Tears streamed down Oscar’s face as if pushing themselves back into motion after having been frozen to a standstill.</p>
<p>“…Ahhh… I can’t…”</p>
<p>The tick-tock sound of a clock’s hands came to his ears. His newly <strong><u>thaw</u></strong>ed heart drummed loudly.</p>
<p>“…so much… so much…”</p>
<p>He raised his hands to cover his face and <strong><u>flinched</u></strong> when he found them to be full of wrinkles. How long had time been stopped for him since those two passed?</p>
<p>“Oh, how I wish you hadn’t died…”</p>
<p>He whispered in a voice mixed with sobs, his face a twisted mess.</p>
<p>“That you’d stayed alive… stayed alive and grown up to be big…”</p>
<p><em>I wanted to see you, grown into a beautiful young woman. I wanted to see you like that. I wanted to see it with my own eyes. Then I should have been the one to die first. Before you. In the end cared for by you. That’s how I should have wanted to die. Not me caring for you at your end. Not how we had it.</em></p>
<p>“Oh, how I miss you…!”</p>
<p>Oscar’s eyes overflowed with tears. They rolled down his cheeks before falling to the ground in large drops.</p>
<p>And <u>into this tear-streaked world</u> <em>tore</em> the crashing sound of Violet sinking into the lake.</p>
<p>Oscar’s brief, <u>glittering</u> moment went dark; just as quickly as it had returned, the sound of his daughter’s voice was lost to him once more.</p>
<p>The image of her smile, too, fled from his mind like a soap bubble suddenly burst.</p>
<p>Oscar had blocked out the world with the palms of his hands. Now he squeezed his eyes shut in further refusal. He tried desperately to cut off this world in which she was lost.</p>
<p><em>Ah, it would be better for me to die here and now. No matter how long I mourn, they will never return. My heart, my breath, I beg of you to stop. My wife and my daughter are dead, and since they have left, life has been as death for me, too. So now, in this moment, I should like to have a bullet pierce me through.</em></p>
<p><em>Like a flower, which can no longer live on once stripped of its <strong><u>petals</u></strong>. But this prayer repeated a hundred million times yet does not come true. I know, for already have I prayed a hundred million times.</em></p>
<hr>
<h1 id="C1P8"><a href="#C1P8" class="headerlink" title="[C1P8]"></a>[C1P8]</h1><p><em>Let me die. Let me die. Let me die. If you would leave me to live alone, rather I would die and be together. Not once had prayer alone brought blessings to him. Not even once!</em></p>
<p>“Sir!”</p>
<p>From the other side, from that shut out world, he heard a voice. It came from someone living in the same time as him. The voice was out of breath and drawing nearer.</p>
<p><em>I’m… alive. I’m still alive. And with that life, I’m fighting to preserve, in some form, the ones I’ve loved and lost.</em></p>
<p>Nothing is granted for prayer alone, but for Oscar, confronted by darkness which no light could pierce, to prayer was where he turned.</p>
<p>“…O, God, please.”</p>
<p><em>If I may not die now, then please, at least in the pages of my story, let that girl be happy. Let her be delighted by my tale. And let her be by my side. Let her be by my side for eternity. Even if only in that story. Even if as but an imaginary daughter. Please, let her be by my side.</em></p>
<p>These things he had to beg.</p>
<p>For in the meantime, his own life continued to stretch on.</p>
<p>Oscar <strong><u>bawled</u></strong> in a manner <strong><u>unbecoming</u></strong> of his age. Before him appeared Violet, <strong><u>drenched</u></strong> head to toe after having dragged herself out of the lake. Water streamed off from her, and her carefully chosen outfit hung <strong><u>limp</u></strong> and ruined.</p>
<p>But Violet herself seemed to be having more fun than she’d ever had before. One might have even thought the expression on her face worthy of being called a smile.</p>
<p>“Were you able to see it? I believe it was three whole steps.”</p>
<p><em>I couldn’t see anything for all the tears</em>, Oscar couldn’t bring himself to say.</p>
<p>So instead, while trying to sniff away his running nose, he answered, “Yes.”</p>
<p>“Yes, I saw you. Thank you, Violet Evergarden.”</p>
<p>He uttered the words with heartfelt respect and gratitude.</p>
<p>“Thank you for making my dream come true. Thank you. I feel as though I’ve witnessed a miracle. I do not believe there is a God, but if there is, surely it must be you.”</p>
<p>Violet looked at him.</p>
<p>“I am an Auto Memories Doll, sir.”</p>
<p>She answered duly, neither denying nor affirming the existence of God.</p>
<p>After that, Oscar drew a bath for Violet, who was completely drenched.</p>
<p>She refused to show herself during meals. But every day she took a bath, and almost certainly she used the bedroom he was providing her to rest herself at night.</p>
<p>She seemed very much human for being an <u>automaton</u>.</p>
<p><em>Modern civilization is quite truly a wonder. And the advances of science are quite remarkable.</em></p>
<p>It just wasn’t proper to let a girl sit around in wet clothes, even if she were mechanical. Having figured she’d need something to change into, Oscar picked up one of his own bathrobes, which he thought reasonably clean, and headed toward the bathroom. It had been so long since he’d had anyone else in the house using the bath that to knock on the door completely slipped his mind. He walked right in to find her not yet changed.</p>
<p>“A… ah, s… so… rr… y? Huh?”</p>
<p>Oscar was so overwhelmed he could hardly find words.</p>
<p>“…What on earth?!”</p>
<p>The image of the naked woman coursed through Oscar’s eyes. She was far more <strong><u>captivating</u></strong>, far more beautiful than any of the Renaissance <strong><u>nude</u></strong>s.</p>
<p>Drips fell <strong><u>anew</u></strong> from her golden locks, these of bathwater. Her eyes sparkled that perfect blue which no brush would ever capture.</p>
<p>Below them, her full lips, her delicate neck, her prominent <strong><u>collarbone</u></strong>, her round breasts, the feminine curves of her figure… In contrast, the artificial arms that extended from shoulder to fingertip on both sides of her body seemed alien, as if they’d just been stuck on.</p>
<p>But everything else.</p>
<p>Though covered in scars, every inch aside from those arms was clearly of flesh and blood.</p>
<p>Every soft swell of her body told the story. This was no automaton, no doll–this was a human being. In the utter shock of his shattered beliefs, Oscar found his eyes scanning her naked form again and again.</p>
<p>“…Sir.”</p>
<p>Violet’s tone was harsh. Oscar, who had until now stood frozen in surprise with those eyes locked on her form, finally seemed to grasp the entirety of the situation he’d put himself in.</p>
<p>“Ahhh! Aaaaaaaaahhhh! AaaaaaaaaaAaaaaaaahhh!!!”</p>
<p>Ironically, after all this, the only scream to be heard came from Oscar himself.</p>
<p>After all but emptying his lungs with the scream, Oscar, both red in the face and seemingly half to tears, demanded of Violet, “You were human all along?”</p>
<p>Violet was wrapping a towel around herself as she answered. “Sir, you are really quite impossible.”</p>
<p>As she uttered these words softly, with a slightly lowered gaze, there appeared the slightest touch of rose in her cheeks.</p>
<p>“The Auto Memories Doll.”</p>
<p>Some time had passed since that term was all the rage. The first one was created by Dr. Orlando, the world’s authority on automatons. It all began when his wife Molly, a novelist, complained of her clouding vision. Molly, having devoted most of her life to her words, was crestfallen as they faded away from her. Once reduced to blindness, it seemed as if her strength also was wasting away.</p>
<p>Dr. Orlando could not bear to see his dear wife this way, and as such he devised the Auto Memories Doll. It was a contraption capable of recording a person’s spoken words: a “borrowed pen,” as it were.</p>
<p>Some of Molly’s following works would even go on to win <strong><u>prestigious</u></strong> literary awards of worldwide renown. Dr. Holland’s invention was praised as an absolute necessity to the course of history. Though at the time he’d meant it merely as a creation for his dearest, his model quickly spread, and soon such dolls were acting to support myriad other people. Thus, Auto Memories Dolls became widely known, even available for rental at a modest price.</p>
<p>…Add to that one more thing.</p>
<p>People–living, breathing people–also worked as scribes, just like the Auto Memories Dolls. In fact, they even shared the same name:</p>
<p>“Auto Memories Dolls.”</p>
<p>Oscar first heard about it from his friend, after Violet’s departure. Apparently Violet was quite well-known across the industry.</p>
<p>When Oscar revealed how he’d mistaken the woman for an automaton, his friend had had a great laugh. When the man finally contained himself, he looked at Oscar with an exasperated look on his face and said, “You really have been away from the world too long.”</p>
<p>“Hah! A machine looking like that. Can you even imagine?”</p>
<p>“How was I supposed to know? You all kept saying, ‘Automaton this, automaton that!’”</p>
<p>“Our technology isn’t <em>that</em> far advanced. It’s just that we have ones that are actual automatons, too. They’re a bit more… <strong><u>quaint</u></strong> than Violet. Figured that wasn’t quite what an isolated shut-in like you needed. She doesn’t talk much, but she’s got some talent for fixing people up. Did a pretty good job with you, eh?”</p>
<p>“…Yeah.”</p>
<p>She was quiet, but yes. She was a very good girl.</p>
<p>“Tell you what. I’ll send along another scribe to help you with your writing for the time being. The non-human kind this time. Just don’t expect anything <strong><u>on par with</u></strong> Violet Evergarden.”</p>
<p>And, before long, a small package arrived at the lakeside house. Inside was a small doll, absolutely nothing like Violet Evergarden.</p>
<p>It wore an adorable little dress and sat quietly on top of Oscar’s desk. It was a little typewriting automaton that recorded all of his words and put them down onto paper. Certainly a remarkable device.</p>
<p>“Nothing like her, though.”</p>
<p>Oscar smiled wryly. Staring <strong><u>blankly</u></strong> at his room, he felt as though he could just make out the face of the scribe now gone.</p>
<p>“I miss you.” Had he said it aloud, he was sure her reply would come.</p>
<p>“Simply impossible, sir.”</p>
<p>In that clear, ringing voice.</p>
<p>Her lips revealing the slightest trace of a smile on her otherwise straight face.</p>
<p>Even without her at his side, he felt quite certain he could hear that voice.</p>

<p>后半回到植物的主题。いつき邀さやか散步，一开始さやか偷懒不想去，后来答应说走路去いつき骑自行车载她回来。两个人在河边发现了つくし和ふきのとう，さやか摘了很多，いつき拿回去做天妇罗，很苦ww</p>
<p>不应该先看后面剧透的啊啊啊啊啊。</p>
<p>第三章比较简单，先说了いつき第一次领到打工的十万工资，拿了四万给さやか，さやか又当作家事的报酬还给了他。然后又接着散步摘花草，这次是西洋芥子菜。いつき就说我喜欢你素颜blabla的骚话，さやか就买了透明粉底ww</p>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>When I first saw this tweet last night, I made up my mind to translate it.</p>
<p><a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/akane29_o8o/status/1111281934288576514" target="_blank" rel="external">https://mobile.twitter.com/akane29_o8o/status/1111281934288576514</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>考えすぎない<br>比べすぎない<br>無理はしない<br>君は君らしく。</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Simple words with deep love.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>non-pensively</p>
<p>incomparably</p>
<p>unexcessively</p>
<p>EGOistically</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>About 「考えすぎない」</p>
<p>Searching for synonyms of ‘overthink’ but fail.</p>
<p>Then get some inspiration from a forum: inordinately (over)contemplated (contemplative), pensive, introspective,</p>
<hr>
<p>Possible translation for the third word「無理」:</p>
<p>unreasonable; unjust; impossible; unnatural; excessive; overwork</p>
<p>Here personally prefer ‘excessive’</p>
<hr>
<p>Seems like I made up some new words lol</p>
<p>translating is so hard.</p>

    <title>小小小小的火</title>
    <url>/190221-a-little-fire/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>伍女士的第二部作品，写作套路和前作无异，也是采用的倒叙的写作方式，讨论的重心也主要是青春期少年少女和他们的父母。<br>首先这一作在话题上又比上一作敏感了不少。关于“火”是什么，读到最后大家应该都明白“火”就是崭新的生命，是孕育的孩子。<br>关于内容和角色我也不想多说，每个人都刻画得很鲜明，像我这种不爱记人名的读者都能够了解到每个人的特征。<br>对于我来说，这本书又谈论的一些话题又引起了我的思考。<br>首先书中最大的孩子布莱恩也才刚刚申请完大学，两个小一点的孩子应该也才中学。在这样的年级别说是接触性了，就算是谈恋爱什么的，对于像我一样出身于比较保守的家庭和学校环境的人来说还是太早了。<br>我没有想象过自己谈恋爱会是什么样子，更不会想象拥有自己的孩子会是什么样的——由于一些童年阴影，我对小孩子是敬而远之。这也是我喜欢年轻的偶像们、比起BG更加喜欢百合作品（尽管某种程度上走向了禁忌的层面）的的原因。不过得知五年前喜欢的人现在已经生下了一个儿子的时候又不由得感慨了。<br>这大概也是欧美和日式作品的区别。可能对于我来说，我还是会更喜欢细腻而又敏感的存在，这样的存在是我高中三年最大的慰藉，也是我尚且短暂的人生中宝贵的体验。<br>还有另外一个话题，也是和前作《无声告白》一样让我陷入思考的，就是上一代的悲剧注定会延续到下一代，如果上一代没有阻止悲剧的延续的话。这种感觉让我回想到第一次读那部烂大街的《小时代》，思来想去其实都是上一代的问题（虽然本作中三个孩子倒是没有受到太多来自父母的负面影响，但是珀尔着实是被米娅影响着）。这个时候我又格外感谢我的父母。我大概从各种各样的地方稍微了解到他们并不是很明朗的过去，但是他们致力于让我获得一个安心安稳的成长环境，并且始终以我为中心。而且在听了许多别人的家庭故事的时候，我再次不由得感觉，有这样的父母应该是很难得的。<br>我致力于让生活变得简单。然后我找到了偶像和学习这样的平衡点，再加上适当的朋友们之间的互动，并且在这样的comfort zone里生活了三四年的时光。虽然说现在正是踏出comfort zone的必要且有效时期，但是我个人来说却依然想要在停留。大概就是让我感受到了这样的矛盾和思考。</p>

    <title>Liz and blue bird</title>
    <url>/190216-Liz-and-blue-bird/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>Liz and blue bird</p>
<p>Which one of the two girls is actually Liz and which one is blue bird? It also happens in real life. Sometimes we think of ourselves to limit others. However, it is we ourselves that  build up the wall in our soul.</p>
<p>The relationship between girls is hard to figure out its insight. There is too much hidden inside the easily-broken heart, albeit everything shows on the unintentional reaction and emotion.</p>
<p>Violet Evergarden</p>
<p>First attracted by its name. I was not good at memorizing the name of characters, esp. when it’s of katakana(foreigner’s name). But since the personality in this animation is clear, and the main story goes smoothly, I had no trouble dealing with them.</p>
<p>Heroine Violet live from the love from Shousa. Shousa saved her life, gave her the beautiful name, Violet, treated her as a real person instead of a war machine, and most tragically, sacrificed his own life in the hope of a better life for her.</p>
<p>I actually cried in the plot of Ann’s mother <em>send</em> a letter to Ann on her birthday every year. </p>
<p>Some comments say that Violet looks like Saber with mechanic arm. To a certain degree I agree to this idea, but we should know that they have thoroughly different background and personality. </p>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>每个人都有自己认为绝对正确的事情。</p>
<p>选择自己的生活方式并且不受到别人的干扰对于我自己来说才是最重要的。</p>
<p>所以别人怎样是不重要的，最重要的是成为自己。</p>
<p>就算是固步自封也好，墨守陈规也罢。</p>
<p>safety zone里的世界的确很舒适。</p>
<p>大概这是我脑子里突然想到的一个很重要的命题。</p>
<hr>
<p>不同人有不同的境遇罢了。</p>
<p>所以看到别人的境况也不必羡慕，却也不必怜悯。</p>
<p>因为那都不是我自己。</p>
<p>我的过去造就了我的现在，我又从现在走向将来。</p>
<p>一步步走下去其实正确答案就在自己的手里。</p>
<p>好不容易到手的机会，现在停下来真的太可惜了。</p>
<hr>
<p>然后就是，我对现在的生活状况还算比较满意吧。</p>
<p>お仕事と推し事都能如愿以偿地进行。</p>
<p>并不是一点迷茫都没有，但是却能选择自己想要的东西。</p>
<p>大概这样几年来的努力某种程度上也算有了回报。</p>
<p>选择喜欢的偶像，选择喜欢的东西。</p>
<p>以前想要去见面，熬半年一年都没法出头。</p>
<p>杳无音讯一周又一周。</p>
<p>以后如果还能这样下去那就是万幸了。</p>
<hr>
<p>结论：</p>
<p>做自己喜欢的自己。</p>

    <title>五本书的读后感</title>
    <url>/180725-bookreports/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<h1 id="《巧克力》"><a href="#《巧克力》" class="headerlink" title="《巧克力》"></a>《巧克力》</h1><p>POINTS：<br>最开始的巧克力是热饮。<br>传入欧洲之后变成了奢侈品。<br>巧克力的普及经历了液体饮料——可冲泡固体饮料——可可粉/巧克力块。<br>最早引入的是荷兰人，最早在日本开始自主生产巧克力的是森永。森永先生在明治维新期间在欧洲学习西点（？）的时候学习到了整套的技术。<br>“明治”其实历史没有想象的长，说是明治其实应该是昭和期间的产物。<br>原来那个在daodunku看到的张开双臂、抬起腿、穿着无袖上衣和短裤的跑步的男子的图案就是格力高的标志！<br>平时看上去平凡无奇的pocky居然在巧克力历史上是这么有里程碑意义的创造！<br>蘑菇和笋原来从这么早就开始撕逼！<br>北海道的代表“白色恋人”的历史比想象的要长！</p>
<p>到最后就没有仔细看完啦，以后研究食品工艺和巧克力的话，这本书可以再买回来好好看一看。</p>
<h1 id="《为什么精英时间管理》"><a href="#《为什么精英时间管理》" class="headerlink" title="《为什么精英时间管理》"></a>《为什么精英时间管理》</h1><p>这本书是今天看的书里面收获最大的一本</p>
<p>首先提到了黄金时间的工作效率问题。<br>书中说到的黄金学习时间是起床后2~3h，以及睡眠前。<br>这让我反思高中尤其是高三的学习。<br>我在高中的常规都是在起床之前学英语，我觉得背单词做阅读这种日常要固定时间，而不赖床的我早起之后这段时间是固定的（毕竟谁都不知道今天的午饭or晚饭要在食堂排队多久。<br>在高三最后一段时间，我在熄灯之后的时间一般都贡献给了物理（但是很惭愧我物理考得特别差），在写到差不多觉得累的时候，我就会看一些作文杂志，或者英语的短篇小说。按照书上说的，睡前15min至关重要，那么我在考试中语文和英语的高分可能多亏于此。<br>（话说回来一个堂堂理科生数理化一团糟却只能靠语文英语拉分真是惭愧不已）</p>
<p>其次让我注目的是运动。<br>最近我也终于开始运动了。嗯终于。<br>但是我感觉要像书上那样说运动之后的效率提高我并不是没有感受到过。<br>但是那还是在体育中考的时候吧——<br>在午后的烈日下上完一节体育课，然后跑回离操场十万八千里的教学楼，还要爬上令人崩溃的六楼，然后去洗手间换件干净衣服。<br>这一切在一个课间基本是来不及做完的，只能一边系着上衣扣子一边从教室后门偷偷溜进去。<br>下面的这节课就不得不集中注意力——因为一般是最凶的老师上的数学课。<br>在这样“不得不”的状态下才能勉强撑过一节课罢了。<br>所以关于运动这方面，我想回头再研读一下找找方法。<br>（哭泣的超重肥宅）</p>
<p>还有一个挺有道理的是15·45·90原则，讲的是人集中注意力的时间。<br>这个该给我将来的泡liba生活一点参考。</p>
<p>还有还有就是读书有输入也要有输出这一点。<br>哪怕几句话也好，也要写点什么东西。<br>新鲜的，属于自己的东西。<br>这也是我突然开始写读后感的原因。</p>
<h1 id="《你所不知道的日本名词的故事1》"><a href="#《你所不知道的日本名词的故事1》" class="headerlink" title="《你所不知道的日本名词的故事1》"></a>《你所不知道的日本名词的故事1》</h1><p>新井一二三（这个名字让我想起了下将棋的加藤一二三）写的这本书算是饶有趣味的，也就一口气读完了。<br>最好玩的应该是第一部份讲吃的，可能因为临近中午我也饿了的原因吧，看着也饥肠辘辘。<br>“春雨”这么美丽的辞藻居然是！<br>“玉子”在日本人看来并不像中国人眼中一样珠圆玉润，而是再普通不过的词语。<br>“天津饭”原来是高级菜肴！</p>
<p>后面讲到“婚活”“就活”才让我对这两个推特上的朋友们经常提到的词语加深了了解，了解了其中的根源在女性走出家庭开始广泛就业。</p>
<p>作者的笔调轻松风趣，完全想不到是日本人笔下的作品了。</p>
<p>第二本有看到，但是书店里没有预览的版本，所以以后有机会在图书馆什么的找找看吧。</p>
<p>补充</p>
<h1 id="《惘然少年时》"><a href="#《惘然少年时》" class="headerlink" title="《惘然少年时》"></a>《惘然少年时》</h1><p>这本书主要讲的作者张惠雯的童年生活和新加坡留学经历。<br>整本书可以分为三个部分。<br>第一部分是上高中之前，讲述了一个小县城里，在计划经济时代作为（类似）公务员女儿的无忧无虑的童年。<br>作者对她生活的县城还是比较喜爱的，笔调也比较有童趣。<br>让我印象深的是家属大院的孩子们。作者写道，那个时候她们从来不记彼此名字，只是记得对方是哪个家属大院的孩子。</p>
<p>第二部分是从高中到S大（猜测是山东大学）。<br>最重要的部分还是作者在S大因为抗拒剪头发所以被停了军训，最后到争取去新加坡留学的过程。<br>其实不光是那个时候，到现在，2018年了，整个中国学校的体制还是有不小的bureaucratic在。<br>但是我相信当思想开放的年轻一代逐渐取代他们走上领导岗位的时候，这一切自然就会发生改编吧。</p>
<p>第三部分是在新加坡留学的故事。<br>从住的公寓，学校生活，再到毕业之后的生活，作者描写了不少，也前面S大的生活形成了鲜明对比。<br>不过这一部分给我印象最深的还是结尾：当作者彷徨不知所向而回到故乡的时候，那个常年保持书信的人终于再次来到她的面前，等待终于成就了夙愿，让我有点小小的感动吧。</p>
<h1 id="《我在德国这些年》"><a href="#《我在德国这些年》" class="headerlink" title="《我在德国这些年》"></a>《我在德国这些年》</h1><p>这本书比起上本书比起来笔调就略显生硬，前半部分完全就是一个科普书的感觉。<br>不过后面写到孩子们，写到作者自己的想法和感情的时候倒是颇引人深思。<br>作者重点提到了中德的文化差异。<br>重点的重点是在育儿方面的。对待孩子的态度，怎样培养孩子，和孩子沟通，不能说谁对谁错，只能说在当下国情来考虑谁更能适应时代需要吧。<br>我也并不是不憧憬一个能够完全信任且给我自由的父母，不过比起中国的大多数家庭里的孩子，我有自知之明我是相当幸福的了。</p>
<p>这两本书都是百花文艺出版社的一个旅外华人的散文系列的。一开始在书城留意到这两本书是因为清秀的封面设计，和不大不小能拿在手上的尺寸。现在开始觉得文库本的尺寸真的是绝佳的看书尺寸了。</p>

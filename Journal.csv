,,,"The theory insists that we don’t fall in love first and foremost with those who care for us in ideal ways, we fall in love with those who care for us in familiar ways"
,,,"We may believe we are seeking happiness in love, but what we are really after is familiarity."
,,,"Each time we recognise a negative, we’re discovering a crucial association in our own minds: we’re alighting on an impossibility of love based on associations from the past projected onto the present."
,,,"A sign of maturity is to accept with good grace that we might be involved in multiple transferences, and to commit oneself to rationally disentangling these, so that we will not need to keep making things tougher for everyone around us."
,,,But it is precisely this sort of reassurance that we often stand in need of.
,,,"We should create room for regular moments, perhaps as often as every few hours, when we can feel unembarrassed and legitimate about asking for confirmation. ‘I really need you; do you still want me?’"
,,,"The Weakness of Strength theory. This dictates that we should always strive to see people’s weaknesses as the inevitable downside of certain merits that drew us to them, and from which we will benefit at other points (even if none of these benefits are apparent right now)"
,,,every strength that an individual has necessarily brings with it a weakness of which it is an inherent part. It is impossible to have strengths without weaknesses. Every virtue has an associated weakness. Not all the virtues can belong together in a single person.
,,,It’s very touching that we live in a world where we have learned to be so kind to children: it would be even nicer if we learned to be a little more generous towards the childlike parts of one another.
,,,Adulthood simply isn’t a complete state; what we call childhood lasts (in a submerged but significant way) all our lives.
,,如果是相互的还好说，但是一方地被当作小孩，我觉得还是很难接受。对象不是妈宝的第二个妈，更何况我觉得在亲子关系中也只有没有语言能力之前可以接受这个样子。,"We are so alive to the idea that it’s patronising to be thought of as younger than we are, we forget that it is also, at times, the greatest privilege for someone to look beyond our adult self in order to engage with – and forgive – the disappointed, furious, inarticulate or wounded child within."
,,,realising that the only release from our longing for this sort of selfless one-directional love is to stop demanding it exclusively for ourselves
,,,All the great Romantic writers were – in their different ways – deeply interested in what might make it hard for a relationship to go well.
,,,"Domestic details, too, look small but carry big important ideas."
,,,"as we shall see, accepting a role for learning and teaching in love belongs to one of the fundamental principles of mature relationships."
,,,"To love someone is, quite simply, according to Romantic philosophy, to love them as they are – without any wish to alter them."
,,,"For the Greeks, given that we are all very imperfect, part of what it means to deepen love is to want to teach – and to be taught."
,,,"We should stop feeling guilty for simply wanting to change our partners, and we should never resent our partners for simply wanting to change us."
,,,"when it comes to relationships, expectations are the enemies of love."
,,,"And, by extension, we’d be assuming from the start that no partner is going to have a complete, reliable or terribly accurate understanding of us."
,,,The error we’re always tempted to make is to see defects as special to our own partner.
,,,We blame everything but our hopes.
,,,"Keeping secrets can seem like a betrayal of the relationship. At the same time, the complete truth eventually appears to place the union in mortal danger."
,,,all of us are both deeply mysterious (to ourselves and to others)
,,,a relationship takes an immense step forward when the parties can move from viewing their lovers as irritating idiots to considering them as loveable fools.
,,,one both desperately wants to be understood and yet is utterly committed to not explaining oneself plainly.
,,,"We should not feel that we are failures, dull-witted, unimaginative or unsophisticated if we recognise a need to learn how to talk to our partners with premeditation and conscious purpose."
,,,"To the Libertine, on the other hand, sex and love are radically distinct entities with an almost accidental, and partial, connection"
,,,"There is, in a sense, only one answer of sorts, and it can be called the Melancholy Position, because it confronts the sad truth that in certain key areas of human existence, there simply are no good solutions."
,,,"in short, one knew that the best sides of oneself did not emerge from being in a family or couple. And that was fine."
,,,We invariably and naturally equate genuine relationships with lifelong relationships.
,,,"Romanticism made the idea of being close to one special other person in a long-term sexual union the very summit of life’s meaning, and subtly discredited alternatives, like devotion to scholarship"
,,,short-term love:
,,,"But in the Classical story, that wiser, less immediately seductive genre, the real problem isn’t finding a partner, it is tolerating them, and being tolerated, over time."
,,,The Classical story accepts that no one ever fully understands anyone els
,,,Love starts with the experience of being understood in a deeply supportive and uncommon way. They understand the lonely parts of you; they grasp who you truly are. This will not continue. There will always be large tracts of one’s psyche that remain incomprehensible to anyone else.

Weaned my young soul from yearning after thine;
Sternly denied its burning wish to hasten
Down to that tomb already more than mine.
And, even yet, I dare not let it languish,
30 Dare not indulge in memory’s rapturous pain;
Once drinking deep of that divinest anguish,
How could I seek the empty world again?"

30 Held backward from that tempting race,
Gazed o’er the sands the waves efface,
To the enduring seas –
There cast my anchor of desire
Deep in unknown eternity;
Nor ever let my spirit tire,
With looking for what is to be!"

Where will these bright things be?
All vanished, like a vision vain,
An unreal mockery"

Above me, in that stormless sea,
I long to hope that all the woe
20   Creation knows, is held in thee!"

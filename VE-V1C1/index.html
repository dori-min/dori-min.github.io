<p><strong><em>Violet Evergarden</em></strong> written by Akatsuki Kana</p>
<p>From the author: I’m writing this letter from the north. Snow Country is a place as quiet as the dead of night. Because of the cold outside, I grew into an adult who <strong>indulges</strong> in movies and stories when at home. I hope that the scenes here, drawn from my imagination, might float with you on your sea of words.</p>
<p><strong>Prologue: “The Auto Memories Doll”</strong></p>
<p>Some time has passed since this term was all the rage. The first one was created by Dr. Orlando, the world’s authority on automatons. It all began when his wife Molly, a novelist, complained of her clouding vision. Molly, having devoted most of her life to her words, was <strong>crestfallen</strong> as they faded away from her. Once reduced to blindness, it seemed as if her strength also was wasting away. Dr. Orlando could not bear to see his dear wife this way, and as such he devised the Auto Memories Doll. It was a <strong>contraption</strong>capable of recording a person’s spoken words: a “borrowed pen,” as it were. At the time, the doctor had meant it merely a creation for his dearest, but the model quickly spread, and soon such dolls were acting to support <strong>myriad</strong> other people. Today Auto Memories Dolls are widely known, even available for rental at a modest price.</p>

<p>Chapter 1: “The Novelist and the Doll”</p>
<p>Roswell was a city of green, <strong><u>ensconced</u></strong> in the beauty of nature. It bared itself among the foothills of tall mountains. Among those of ample resource, Roswell was known as a summer <strong><u>retreat</u></strong>; a town of villas and cottages, homes away from home.</p>
<p>In spring, the landscapes burst with flowers, bringing light to their admirers’ eyes. In summer, hikers there sought a moment of respite beside the city’s famed waterfall, well-loved for ages. In autumn, the rain of leaves softened the heart, and in winter the world itself was <strong><u>bestowed</u></strong> a mute <strong><u>tranquility</u></strong>. Each season’s flourish on stage was distinct; it was a land <strong><u>magnanimous</u></strong> upon the eyes of visitors at any time of year.</p>
<p>Vacation homes throughout the town formed a <strong><u>swatch</u></strong> of <strong><u>variegated</u></strong> wooden rooftops, both big and small. Land there was not cheap. Simply owning a home in Roswell was a sufficient sign of affluence.</p>
<p>In the city’s heart, countless shops courted one main throughway and catered to endless tourists. During holidays, this corridor was inevitably thronged with shoppers, and the people created a fabric of <strong><u>cacophony</u></strong> appropriate to city life, each weaving his happy <strong><u>bustle</u></strong> into the song of the street. The wares set out were nothing to <strong><u>scoff</u></strong> at–far from so, in fact, given the town’s remote location.</p>
<p>Most residents of Roswell sought convenience and so built their villas in the city proper. Those who settled elsewhere were the town eccentrics.</p>
<p>It was now autumn in Roswell. <strong><u>Cirrocumulus</u></strong> <strong><u>wafted</u></strong> in <strong><u>ripples</u></strong> high up in the sky. Far removed from the <strong><u>foothills</u></strong> was a small lake, an almost forgotten stop along the town’s busy tourist circuit. One small cottage stood quietly by its waters.</p>
<p>Viewed with kindness, it was a vintage home bearing a distinguished <strong><u>facade</u></strong>. To less forgiving eyes, the house was a monument to disrepair, long abandoned by human hands. One first had to pass under its arched gates, white now only by virtue of their long companionship with the sun. From there, a short path led through a garden buried in weeds and nameless flowers. Finally, at the path’s end, the home itself came into view.</p>
<p>The red brick walls were in such decay that one could only conclude the owner had no intent of ever patching them. Here and there a roof tile was split, once-orderly ranks now cruelly dismembered.</p>
<p>Immediately next to the entrance, vines had coiled themselves in knots about a swing, ensuring that it would swing no more. It was both evidence of a child and evidence that the child was certainly here no longer.</p>
<p>The owner of the house was a man in the prime of life. His name was Oscar.</p>
<p>He was a screenwriter working without <strong><u>pretense</u></strong> of <strong><u>nom de plume</u></strong>. His hair was red with a curl, and his black-rimmed glasses could hardly contain the thick lenses with which they had been charged. Oscar’s back was slightly <strong><u>hunched</u></strong>, but his face was fresh, lending him an air of youthfulness belying his real age. Sensitive to the cold, he was never without a sweater. All in all, Oscar was an unremarkable man, hardly seeming fit to be the hero of any story.</p>
<p>To Oscar, this house was not a villa. Quite simply, Roswell was home, and it was in this house that Oscar lived.</p>
<p>It was built to house not him alone, but also his wife and young daughter. The rooms had been quite spacious for three, but now they were used by only one. Oscar lived alone. Both his wife and child had already departed for the other world.</p>
<p>The wife had <strong><u>succumbed</u></strong> to an illness with a name so <strong><u>meandering</u></strong> it was hard to even remember.</p>
<p>To put it simply, her blood had <strong><u>coagulated</u></strong> in her veins, blocking them. Death quickly followed. The condition was genetic. Her father, too, had suffered that fate.</p>
<p>Oscar had known his wife was an orphan. He’d heard her <strong><u>plaintive</u></strong> story of the many from her family who had died young. But it was not until after she died that he grasped the true reason for this.</p>
<p>At the funeral, her close friend had <strong><u>confided</u></strong> in Oscar. “She was frightened. She thought if it were known, no one would ever want to marry her. So she kept it hidden.” When the words hit Oscar’s ears, only one thought echoed through his mind: “Why?”</p>
<p>“Why? Why? Why?”</p>
<p><em>All you had to do was say it. You could have shared anything with me.</em></p>
<p><em>There’s so much we could have done. We could have searched together for a cure. We had all this useless excess of money to throw at it.</em></p>
<p>It was clear that Oscar’s wife had not married him for his money. They’d met before his break as a screenwriter. She was a librarian at the library he frequented. And in any case, it was Oscar himself who first began to stare.</p>
<p><em>How pretty</em>, he’d thought.</p>
<p><em>And she’s the one in charge of the new arrivals corner. It always has such good books.</em></p>
<p>As he fell in love with her books, so too did he fall in love with her.</p>
<p>“Why?” The question echoed some hundred million times. It buaround his mind, then finally vanished.</p>
<p>His wife’s friend was an accomplished woman. While Oscar’s heart <strong><u>floundered</u></strong> in the wake of loss, she worked vigorously to attend to the young daughter who had been left in Oscar’s care. Left to himself, the man would go all day without eating, so she brought warm food to their home. The girl, in turn, sobbed for her missing mother, so with her she sat, gently tying the girl’s hair in braids as her mother used to do.</p>
<p>Perhaps, for a brief moment, there had been a spark of love between Oscar and this woman. Late one night, when Oscar’s daughter had been sick in bed with a fever and had suddenly begun to <strong><u>vomit</u></strong> uncontrollably, it was she who rushed the girl to the hospital. And it was she, not Oscar, who first learned that the girl was <strong><u>afflicted</u></strong> with the same <strong><u>ailment</u></strong>.</p>
<p>From there, the disease progressed gradually. But for Oscar, it was all much too fast.</p>
<hr>
<h1 id="C1P2"><a href="#C1P2" class="headerlink" title="[C1P2]"></a>[C1P2]</h1><p>Desperate to avoid a repeat of their recent tragedy, Oscar turned to the finest physicians from across the land. They moved from one great hospital to the next. Oscar implored each doctor they met, and through his appeals learned of a new, experimental treatment. The decision seemed an easy one.</p>
<p>Yet every herb has its <strong>demons</strong>. The girl <strong>clamored</strong> with each swallow, a sight which ate away at her <strong>doting</strong> father as the days of treatment stretched on.</p>
<p>The new treatment seemed to have no effect on her symptoms. Having no further recourse, the doctors declared it a lost cause and withdrew from the fight.</p>
<p>Oscar became <strong>plagued</strong> with the <strong>absurd</strong> notion that his lonely wife was <strong>beckon</strong>ing to their daughter from the world beyond. He <strong>wailed</strong> at her grave, “Don’t take her from me!” But the dead speak no words.</p>
<p>Oscar was <strong>teetering</strong> on the edge. Perhaps unexpectedly, it was his wife’s friend who broke first. Exhausted by endless <strong>fret</strong>ting as the girl <strong>hung in limbo</strong>, she appeared less and less often at the hospital, then finally stopped coming altogether. Oscar and his daughter were now truly alone. The girl’s extensive medication had left her <strong>emaciated</strong>. Her once-milky skin was a sickly yellow and her once-rosy cheeks <strong>pallid</strong>.</p>
<p>Her honeyed hair, too, was now falling out.</p>
<p>Oscar could no longer bear to look at her.</p>
<p>After endlessly pushing fruitless questions upon the doctors, he finally <strong>relent</strong>ed. The girl would continue on <strong>analgesics</strong> alone. All other treatment would stop. Oscar resolved that if nothing else, his daughter’s short life would not end in suffering.</p>
<p>The next while was peaceful. They spent happy days together. He saw his daughter smile for the first time in months. So continued their last few days of light.</p>
<p>It was glorious autumn outside on the day that she died. Color was slipping from the world drip by drip, but the sky was bright blue and cloudless. From the window, one caught <strong>candid</strong> glimpses of trees dressed in reds and yellows. A fountain stood in the hospital grounds, offering <strong>respite</strong> to the <strong>weary</strong>. Fallen leaves floated soundlessly across its pool.</p>
<p>Each leaf there had fallen to the water’s surface and <strong>drifted</strong> there until finally pulled into a <strong>clump</strong> of <strong>comrade</strong>s. Now they floated aimlessly together. New leaves were always pulled in, almost as if by magnet. Thus, even in their <strong>wreckage</strong>, lives lost to the season, they emerged in beautiful <strong>synchronization</strong>.</p>
<p>On seeing them, the girl spoke. “How pretty.</p>
<p>“The way the water’s blue and the color of the leaves mix together. It’s so pretty. Father, if a person stepped on those leaves, do you think they’d walk across the pond without falling in?”</p>
<p>Ah, the innocence of a child. Surely gravity and weight would conspire to bring one’s body plunging in, but Oscar could deny his daughter no more.</p>
<p>“And if you held an umbrella, my sweet, you could use the wind and perhaps even float just above it.”</p>
<p>His tone was playful. He longed so badly to dote on his helpless daughter just a little more. And as she listened to his words, her eyes sparkled. “Yes. Yes, that’s just what I’ll do. I’ll dance across the water for you.”</p>
<p><em>Someday I’ll dance for you. On the lake, by our home now far away. When the leaves drift across the water in autumn.</em></p>
<p>Shortly after, she fell into a coughing fit. One cough, two, then several more. And then, as if stolen away, she was gone.</p>
<p>She had been but nine years old.</p>
<p>When Oscar brought his arms under the <strong>husk</strong> she had left behind, it felt dreadfully light. Too light, even for a body now short a soul.</p>
<p>Had she ever even been alive? Had it just been one long dream? Tears came to his eyes.</p>
<p>The girl was buried alongside her mother. Oscar returned to the house built for three, and there he began his life of silence.</p>
<p>Oscar had financial means enough to live on without working. A royalty system brought in money each time his widely-used scripts were employed. He would never <strong>scrape</strong> the bottom of his savings, and he would never go hungry.</p>
<p>After several years of mourning for his wife and daughter, a long-lost work acquaintance reached out to Oscar. Wouldn’t he try his hand at one more script?</p>
<p>It was <strong>at the behest of</strong> an elite performing <strong>troupe</strong>, one which any actor would clamor to be a part of. For Oscar, whose past work was known but who had all but vanished from the industry, it was an honor simply to be asked.</p>
<p>He’d spent so many days <strong>languishing</strong> in <strong>sloth</strong>, <strong>wallowing</strong> in sadness, <strong>indulging</strong> in self-pity.</p>
<p>Man is a thing that tires. Whether happiness or sadness, he cannot bear to live always with that alone. That is how he is built.</p>
<p>Oscar agreed to the job in his second reply, determined to lift his pen once more.</p>
<p>But here the trouble began. In desperation to escape his <strong>harsh</strong> reality, Oscar had turned to–no, embraced–the bottle. And with it came a <strong>smattering</strong> of drugs to ensure happy thoughts at least in dreams. With the help of his doctor he had somehow managed to conquer the drink and drugs themselves, yet in their wake, his hands were left forever trembling.</p>
<p>Whether words laid on paper or struck with keys, his efforts to push forward seemed hopeless.</p>
<p>His breast was full with words; he merely needed to find the way to bring them forth.</p>
<p>He turned once more to his acquaintance to ask for advice.</p>
<p>“I’ve just the thing.</p>
<p>“We need to get you an Auto Memories Doll.”</p>
<p>“What’s that?”</p>
<p>“Ah, my friend, you’ve been away from the world too long… I’m worried about you. Auto Memories Dolls. Everybody knows about them. You can even rent them out. Hardly costs a thing anymore. Yes, that’s what we’ll do. I’ll have one sent over for you to try out.”</p>
<p>“I’m going to get help from a… doll?”</p>
<p>“Hah! A special kind of doll, to be sure.”</p>
<p>And that was how Oscar came to use a new kind of tool, one whose name he’d only just learned. Oscar and the “Auto Memories Doll.” This was the beginning of their fates <strong>entwined</strong>.</p>
<hr>
<h1 id="C1P3"><a href="#C1P3" class="headerlink" title="[C1P3]"></a>[C1P3]</h1><p>A woman made her way up the mountain path.</p>
<p>Her bangs hung freely. <strong><u>Braids</u></strong> laced the crown of her head, held together with a ribbon of deep, <strong><u>velvety</u></strong> red. Her slender frame was wrapped in a snowy white summer dress tied at the waist.</p>
<p>The dress’ silk, <strong><u>pleated</u></strong> skirt <strong><u>fluttered</u></strong> <strong><u>angelically</u></strong> with each step she took. The <u>emerald</u> <strong><u>brooch</u></strong> <strong><u>affix</u></strong>ed at her <strong><u>bosom</u></strong>&lt;/u&gt; <u><strong>sparkled</strong></u>.</p>
<p>Over the dress, she wore a <strong><u>sleek</u></strong>, Prussian blue jacket. Her long boots had deepened into a cocoa brown with age. And on this day, as she passed under the white arch of Oscar’s home, she held in her hand a heavy-looking <strong><u>trunk</u></strong>.</p>
<p>Just as the woman stepped into the front garden, a <strong><u>gust</u></strong> of autumn wind <strong><u>bellowed</u></strong>, bringing red, yellow, and brown leaves <strong><u>swirling</u></strong> about her in dancing rings. Her vision seemed to <strong><u>falter</u></strong>, as if these swirling <strong><u>remnants</u></strong> of autumn had pulled a curtain down before her. She reached a hand to the brooch affixed at her breast, squeezed it tight, and <strong><u>intoned</u></strong> in a low voice some words that were <strong><u>eclipse</u></strong>d by those wings of autumn as they continued to flutter excitedly. Having reached no ears, the spoken words melted away into space.</p>
<p>When the <strong><u>mischievous</u></strong> wind died down, the woman seemed to set aside her recent display of uncertainty. She continued on to the entryway with purpose. There she pressed on the buzzer with one finger of a hand <strong><u>encased</u></strong> in black glove.</p>
<p>The house’s bell <strong><u>reverberated</u></strong> like a screech escaped from hell. A moment later, the door opened. The house’s red-haired owner <strong><u>peer</u></strong>ed out from the gap. It was hard to tell whether he’d just woken up or whether he’d not slept at all. In either case, he was clearly in no state to be receiving guests. His clothing and face were both <strong><u>disheveled</u></strong>. On seeing the woman, Oscar let slip a slight look of surprise. He seemed to have <strong><u>been taken aback</u></strong> by the woman’s most <strong><u>peculiar</u></strong> appearance.</p>
<p>Or perhaps he had been caught off guard by her singular beauty. Whatever the case, he found himself, for a moment, short of breath.</p>
<p>“You’re… the ‘Auto Memories Doll’?”</p>
<p>“That is correct. Please inform me of any assistance you might require, and I will be happy to oblige. Auto Memories Doll Violet Evergarden, at your service.”</p>
<p>The storybook blonde-haired, blue-eyed beauty spoke these words with no trace of <strong><u>obsequiousness</u></strong>. Rather, they <strong><u>emanated</u></strong> from her lips with the deep clarity of a well-polished gemstone.</p>
<p>The woman who had identified herself as Violet Evergarden carried herself in quiet beauty, the very <strong>essence</strong> of a doll. Her blue eyes, <u>lace</u>d by eyelashes of golden thread, sparkled with the mysteries of the seabed. From the milk-white skin of her cheek blushed the <strong><u>splendor</u></strong> of cherry petals at their peak. Her <strong><u>rouge-tinted lips</u></strong> <strong><u>glistened</u></strong> invitingly.</p>
<p>Nothing about her was lacking. <u>Her beauty was as full as the moon at its peak.</u></p>
<p>Had she not blinked, one would have thought she was a static work of art.</p>
<p>Oscar knew nothing about Auto Memories Dolls. The arrangements for Violet’s arrival had been handled entirely by the same friend who had convinced Oscar to take on this new writing job.</p>
<p>“It’ll be delivered in a few days,” he’d said.</p>
<p>And here she was at last.</p>
<p>From the way his friend spoke, Oscar had assumed some small package would arrive at his door, care of the postman. He’d open up the box and inside would be a small, mechanical doll. He was hardly prepared for this thing so lifelike, this… <strong><u>automaton</u></strong>.</p>
<p><em>How far has civilization progressed while I’ve <u>holed myself up</u> here?</em></p>
<p>Oscar had never shown particular interest in any of the ways of the world. He read no newspapers or magazines, and he rarely socialized. If it weren’t for the friends who showed concern for him, perhaps his only interaction would have been with the deliveryman from the grocer’s.</p>
<p>Already Oscar was regretting his hasty decision. Clearly he should have spent more time looking into the matter of the doll before giving his consent. The mere thought of having another person in the house meant only for that long-lost family of three did not sit well with him. It was like an unpleasant aftertaste. Another person… or something that resembled one, anyway.</p>
<p>Oscar felt as if he were somehow betraying his family.</p>
<p>Violet, perfectly unaware of any of these thoughts <u>swirling</u> about Oscar’s head, followed him into the living room and set herself down on the sofa when invited. When Oscar offered her tea, she drank it. These modern automatons seemed to be quite advanced.</p>
<p>“What happens to the tea after you drink it?”</p>
<p>Sensing Oscar’s tone of disbelief, Violet gently tipped her head to one side as she answered. “Ultimately it is discharged from my body, after which I believe it returns to the Earth.”</p>
<p>An answer befitting of a machine.</p>
<p>“To tell the truth… I’m at a bit of a loss right now. You’re a bit… different from what I expected.”</p>
<p>Violet glanced down as if to confirm her own appearance, then abruptly stood up from the sofa and returned Oscar’s stare.</p>
<p>“Is there something about me which does not meet your expectations?”</p>
<p>“Uh… well, it’s not exactly my expectations…”</p>
<p>“If the additional wait would not inconvenience you, I can arrange for the <strong><u>dispatch</u></strong> of a different doll, one more suitable to your needs.”</p>
<p>“Ah, no… that’s not what I’m trying to say. Uh, well… let’s just try this out, I suppose. If you can do the work, that’s all that matters. You seem un<strong><u>obtrusive</u></strong> enough.”</p>
<p>“If it pleases you, I will restrict my respiration to the minimally required level.”</p>
<p>“Ah, no, that won’t be necessary.”</p>
<hr>
<h1 id="C1P4"><a href="#C1P4" class="headerlink" title="[C1P4]"></a>[C1P4]</h1><p>“I have been dispatched here to fulfill your need for a scribe. I will perform my duties to your utmost satisfaction so as to not sully the Auto Memories Doll name. It matters not whether my tools are pen and paper or typewriter. Please make use of me as planned.”</p>
<p>Violet uttered these words with her large, jewel-like eyes affixed firmly on Oscar’s. It made Oscar feel a bit <strong>fidgety</strong>, but he managed to answer with an awkward nod.</p>
<p>The doll had been requested for a period of two weeks. They had only that much time to complete one full script.</p>
<p>Oscar composed himself and led Violet into his study, intending to begin work immediately.</p>
<p>However, on arrival there, it became clear that Violet’s first duties would not be as a scribe but as a housekeeper.</p>
<p>Oscar had pulled everything necessary into one room for it to double as both an office and a bedroom. <strong>Strewn</strong> about the floor were dirtied clothes and dishes filled with half-eaten meals. It was a miserable <strong>spectacle</strong>. Such was the mess that one could hardly find space to walk across the floor.</p>
<p>Violet remained silent as she again trained her blue eyes upon Oscar. The eyes themselves seemed to accuse. <em>Did you do anything at all to prepare for my arrival?</em></p>
<p>“…I’m sorry.”</p>
<p>Oscar himself knew that it was not a room befitting a working man. Since beginning his days alone, Oscar had hardly touched the living room. As a result, that room had remained in quite a <strong>presentable</strong> state. But the <strong>well-trodden</strong> rooms of his house–this office, the washroom, and the bathroom–had all fallen into a most <strong>wretched</strong> state.</p>
<p>He suddenly felt quite grateful that Violet was an automaton.</p>
<p>Her physical appearance suggested a young woman at the twilight of her teens, or perhaps in her early twenties. Oscar could think of any number of other torturous things he would prefer to endure than the situation of having to show a real girl of that age this embarrassment of an office. It was un<strong>chivalrous</strong>, and Oscar’s advancing years were no excuse.</p>
<p>“Sir, I must respectfully remind you that I am here to act as a scribe, not as a maid.”</p>
<p>Yet even as she spoke, Violet pulled from her trunk a white, frilled apron and began cleaning the room with a certain zeal. Thus passed their first day.</p>
<p>On the second, they finally managed to both seat themselves in the office and set about the real work ahead.</p>
<p>To be more precise, Oscar reclined on the bed, and Violet sat in the office’s lone chair. She rested her hands on the typewriter stationed at the desk.</p>
<p>“She spoke–”</p>
<p>As Oscar began to dictate his story, Violet’s hands moved over the keys with a flurry of speed. Her strokes were yet quiet, and of course performed perfectly from memory. Oscar’s eyes grew wide with surprise.</p>
<p>“You’re quite… fast, aren’t you?”</p>
<p>On receiving the compliment, Violet rolled up her sleeve and removed the black glove from one hand. She held the exposed arm up for Oscar to see. It ticked and whirred. A completely mechanical arm. The fingers and knuckles were of especially sturdy construction, finished with only a rudimentary coat of paint. “My parts have been chosen for maximum utility while still simulating human form. These were produced by Estark. They are renowned for their durability. They also boast a range of movement and compressive strength far exceeding that of human hands. They will suffice in allowing me to record your words precisely as you dictate.”</p>
<p>“Is that so… Uh, well, you don’t need to write down what I’m saying now. Just the words in the script.”</p>
<p>Oscar resumed his dictation. They took several breaks, but for the first day of writing, it seemed to go quite well.</p>
<p>Of course, he’d already had the play structured out somewhere in his mind. So far it had seemed quite easy to find the words.</p>
<p>And as he spoke, Oscar realized that Violet was a superb <strong>conduit</strong> and scribe. From the beginning, he’d noted her quiet appearance, and as they began to work she was every bit faithful to this impression. Though he hadn’t gone so far to ask it of her, he found that he really could not hear the sound of her breathing. The only sound at all in the room, besides Oscar’s own voice, was the click, clack of the typewriter. If he closed his eyes, it almost seemed as if he were pushing the keys himself. When he asked her to read back passages to check his progress, her voice was clear and perfectly <strong>inflected</strong>. Just listening to it was a joy.</p>
<p>Through her voice, every passage seemed a <strong>majestic</strong> tale.</p>
<p><em>So this is what has made them so popular.</em></p>
<p>He finally seemed to gain a deep appreciation for the qualities of the Auto Memories Doll.</p>
<p>But Oscar and Violet’s smooth progress halted abruptly on the fourth day. Several days passed without so much as a word written. Oscar was <strong>plagued</strong> with the writer’s most common <strong>affliction</strong>. Though the story seemed clear to him, the words would not spin together into the fabric they were meant to be.</p>
<p>Long years of experience had taught Oscar what he must do in this situation. The answer was simple: stop writing. He was of the firm belief that no great writing was born when forced.</p>
<p>He regretted having to make Violet wait.</p>
<p>Violet, for her part, quickly and seriously complied with requests for any other type of work around the house, from cleaning to cooking. She seemed to have been designed with, first and <strong>foremost</strong>, a hardworking disposition. It had been quite some time since Oscar had eaten a home-cooked meal, still <strong>wafting up steam</strong> on service. He’d had many a meal delivered and occasionally even went out to eat, but such foods somehow paled in comparison with a simple meal prepared through the labors of a well-meaning novice.</p>
<p>He ate unusual <strong>omelets</strong> whose every bite melted in his mouth. He ate a <strong>patty</strong> of hamburger mixed with tofu, presented on serving as “an exotic recipe carried from lands far to the East.” He ate fine <strong>pilafs</strong> of rice mixed with <strong>tangy</strong> sauces and flourishes of colorful vegetables. He ate seafood <strong>au gratin</strong>, a rare gem in this mountainous land. Violet inevitably balanced the meal with some sort of salad or soup on the side. Oscar was quite <strong>awed</strong> by it all.</p>
<hr>
<h1 id="C1P5"><a href="#C1P5" class="headerlink" title="[C1P5]"></a>[C1P5]</h1><p>At every meal, she gazed at him quietly and did not say a word.</p>
<p>Even when he invited her to join him, she politely, yet firmly, refused. “Thank you, but I will take my own meal afterward.” He had seen her consume liquid that first day, but he had yet to see her eat solid food. Perhaps that was beyond her scope. He briefly fancied her <strong><u>guzzling down</u></strong> mineral oil during those meals she insisted taking in strict privacy. The thought of it spawned a series of surreal images in his mind.</p>
<p><em>There’s really no need to exercise all this restraint. I wish you’d just sit down and have a meal together with me.</em></p>
<p>Oscar <strong><u>mulled the words</u></strong> over in his mind but could never quite bring them to voice. Violet was nothing like his late wife. Yet Oscar often found himself watching the back of her slender frame as she worked in the kitchen, and when he did, he was filled with a strange sense of familiarity. If he stared too long, he’d be struck by an excess of <strong><u>melancholy</u></strong>, and tears would <strong><u>inexplicably</u></strong> <u>well</u> in his eyes. This addition of a new person in Oscar’s world had led him to quite an unexpected realization.</p>
<p><em>I’ve been leading an ever-so-lonely life.</em></p>
<p>The <strong><u>elation</u></strong> of meeting Violet at the doorway when she returned from some <strong><u>errand</u></strong>… The secure feeling that he was not alone in that house when he went to bed at night… The reality that Violet was there, always there, whenever he opened his eyes… All these things impressed upon him the extent of his previous isolation.</p>
<p>He had his money, and he found nothing wanting in his lifestyle. But in truth, his comforts brought no sense of enrichment. In fact, they were hardly more than a thin, final sheet trying vainly to guard his <strong><u>downtrodden</u></strong> heart against any more abuse.</p>
<p>Certainly, they were doing nothing to heal those wounds.</p>
<p>Someone was there, and that someone–even if not a person with whom he was yet particularly close–was waking up in the morning in just the same place and at just the same time as he was.</p>
<p>Such thoughts pierced the heart Oscar had kept tightly closed for so long.</p>
<p>Violet was a <strong><u>ripple</u></strong> upon Oscar’s <strong><u>stagnant</u></strong> life. She brought no <strong><u>strife</u></strong>, but her very presence was a slight change to the waters of his lake. A cold, lifeless stone had struck the surface, and somehow it had brought a warm current to his <strong><u>monotony</u></strong>, to his <strong><u>sluggish</u></strong> pool. He <strong><u>feign</u></strong>ed not knowing whether this change was good or bad. But if pressed, he just might have been ready to admit the likelihood of it being for the better.</p>
<p>At the very least, the melancholy <strong><u>unearth</u></strong>ed by Violet’s presence and the tears it <strong><u>wrought</u></strong> were somehow warmer than the feelings and tears he had <u>bled</u> before.</p>
<p>When there were only three days left with Violet, Oscar finally lifted himself out of idleness. One certain scene had been responsible for this long stewing.</p>
<p>Oscar had charged Violet with a tale of adventure and mystery. At its head was a young, lone heroine. Her travels far and wide were filled with faces and encounters of every type. And over the course of her journey, she became something more than she had been before.</p>
<p>The template for this heroine was Oscar’s late daughter. At the end of the tale, she returned to the home she had left so long ago. And at that home, her elderly father sat waiting. Yet when the heroine appeared, now a splendid young woman so far beyond the little girl of the past, not even her own father could recognize her.</p>
<p>With tear-stained cheeks, the heroine would <strong><u>plead</u></strong> with her father. “Don’t you remember?” And here she would repeat the promise she had made to him so long ago: the promise to dance across the fallen leaves strewn across the surface of their lake.</p>
<p>“It is quite impossible for a human to walk across water.”</p>
<p>“I need a visual to work with. Please. In the story, she’ll be able to do it because of help from the water spirit–the one whose protection she received during the journey.”</p>
<p>“Even if that’s the case… I’m hardly suitable for this sort of thing. The girl of the story is lighthearted and charming. She’s sweetly innocent. She’s in complete contrast to me.”</p>
<p>The novelist and the Auto Memories Doll had come to a head.</p>
<p>It was all because of a request made by Oscar. He’d asked Violet to dress up like the heroine and to <u>splash</u> around in the water along the lakeshore next to his cottage. He’d already asked her to clean his house, to do his laundry, to take care of all his household chores. And now came this. It was as if he expected her to be outfitted for anything.</p>
<p>Violet, who had until now played the part of the cool-headed working woman, had finally reached her limit. “You’re simply impossible.”</p>
<p>“Your hair, it’s almost the same blonde as my daughter’s. If you were to let it down and to put on a summer dress, then it’d be just…”</p>
<p>“Sir… my purpose, first and foremost, is to serve as a scribe. I am an Auto Memories Doll. I am neither your wife nor your mistress. I am not capable of acting as a substitute for anyone else.”</p>
<p>“I, I know that. I’m not about to get any undue ideas about a young thing like you. It’s just that your… the way you look… I mean, if my daughter were still alive, she’d be just about your height, and… I’d just thought…”</p>
<p>Violet, who had up to that point rejected the very idea earnestly, suddenly faltered. Her expression wavered visibly.</p>
<p>“…I had assumed this was an expression of your <strong><u>peculiar</u></strong>… tastes. I had not realized you’d lost a daughter.”</p>
<p>Violet chewed her lip. Her face betrayed a struggle of conscience.</p>
<p>Over these past few days, Oscar had realized something about Violet. In the battle of good and evil, she clearly stood on the side of good.</p>
<p>“I am an Auto Memories Doll… I exist to execute the desires of my clients… yet I feel as if this request is in conflict with my professional <strong><u>decorum</u></strong>…”</p>
<p>Watching her mumble the pros and cons over by herself, Oscar felt a <strong><u>twinge</u></strong> of regret, yet he decided to try one final push.</p>
<hr>
<h1 id="C1P6"><a href="#C1P6" class="headerlink" title="[C1P6]"></a>[C1P6]</h1><p>“If I can just see that scene, of the daughter all grown up, coming home to fulfill her promise, I know I’ll be able to finally write it. I’m sure of it. I’ll be happy to make it up to you in any way I can. I’ll pay twice your original fee. This story is everything to me. If I can just write it, it’ll be a new beginning for me. A turning point in life. Please.”</p>
<p>“But… I am most certainly not a… dress-up toy.”</p>
<p>“If that’s how you feel, I’ll promise you right here: No pictures.”</p>
<p>“You had intended to take pictures?!”</p>
<p>“OK! No pictures! I’ll burn the image into my brain and use it to write the story. Violet, please.”</p>
<p>For some moments afterward, Violet stood with a <strong><u>scrunched</u></strong> face and continued to mull the idea over, but in the end, she was beaten out by Oscar’s <strong><u>tenacity</u></strong>. One might have suspected she was of the type easily pressured into things.</p>
<p>Oscar, so excited by their new understanding, broke his long <strong><u>reclusion</u></strong> by heading out to town to purchase fine clothes and an umbrella for Violet.</p>
<p>He brought back a two-tone dress of white lace on top and blue on bottom, with a ribbon-belted waist. The umbrella was sky blue with white stripes, its <strong><u>canopy</u></strong> edged in <strong>frills</strong>. Violet seemed particularly pleased with the umbrella, and after he handed it to her she snapped it open and closed, open and closed, then <u><strong>twirled</strong></u> it around in her hands.</p>
<p>“Haven’t you ever had an umbrella before?”</p>
<p>“I have. But I had not known of ones as delightful as this.”</p>
<p>“Is that so? You’re always dressed in such charming outfits. I’d thought following fashion was a hobby of yours.”</p>
<p>“I merely dress according to the recommendations set forth by my superiors at the agency. I do not frequent dressmakers’ or other such shops myself.”</p>
<p>It was as if she were a child dressed up in clothing chosen by her mother. A new thought struck Oscar. <em>Perhaps she’s really much younger than I’d guessed</em>. And suddenly Violet seemed to Oscar a fraction less a woman and a tad more a child.</p>
<p>Now finished shopping, Oscar hurriedly motioned for Violet to change her clothes–before she could change her mind.</p>
<p>It was early afternoon. The sky was mildly <strong><u>overcast</u></strong>. Rain seemed unlikely, yet its perfume hung in the air. A chill wind danced about, <strong><u>herald</u></strong>ing autumn, but not yet harsh enough to <strong><u>sting</u></strong>.</p>
<p>Oscar had already gone outside to wait. He sat down in a wooden chair he’d carried right up to the side of the lake and began smoking a pipe.</p>
<p>Since Violet’s arrival, he’d refrained from smoking out of a vague sense of consideration. Now, after that long fast, the smoke seemed to <strong><u>permeate</u></strong> all the way down to his belly. Several minutes had passed of him blowing rings that hung lazily in the air when came the plaintive screech of the drooping, unoiled front door.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry to have kept you.”</p>
<p>He twisted his neck to meet her exquisite voice.</p>
<p>“No…”</p>
<p>–<em>trouble at all, my dear</em>, he’d meant to say, but his breath had taken flight, leaving him alone with his words.</p>
<p>With those unspoken words still caught in his throat, Oscar stared in <strong><u>awe</u></strong> at Violet. It was like he was seeing her for the first time all over again. With her hair let down, she had enough charm to steal time away from any eyes placed upon her. Her braided hair flowed gently down across her frame in a gentle curve. It was much longer than he’d thought. But, more than that–</p>
<p><em>If she’d lived to this age, this is just how she’d look.</em></p>
<p>He thought of all those years he should have been able to spend watching his daughter dressing up, playing pretend, and a burning feeling welled up from his chest.</p>
<p>“Are you satisfied with the appearance of the clothing you selected for me?”</p>
<p>She <strong><u>clutched</u></strong> the <strong><u>hem</u></strong> of her skirt in one hand and spun in place. It was as if she had floated down into this world of autumn colors from another realm. Such was the beauty of this <strong>divine-faced</strong> young woman.</p>
<p>“If it pleases you, I will proceed to the lake so you may begin your observations… That is what you had in mind, correct? For the scene you would like to compose? Rather than simply have me walk around in this outfit, it would be preferable for you to see me on the surface of the water, if only for a few seconds. Sir, leave everything to me. My mobility is of the highest <strong><u>caliber</u></strong>. I can provide you with the scene you require, if only briefly.”</p>
<p>Oscar, busy with half a dozen <strong>tugging</strong> emotions, simply nodded and gave faint murmurs of consent during all this <strong><u>discourse</u></strong>. Violet paid his condition no mind, delivering her words with her usual cool, matter-of-fact tone.</p>
<p>The young woman before Oscar was someone quite different from his daughter. Though she had the same golden locks, there was no sweet sparkle in her eyes.</p>
<p>Violet’s umbrella was closed. She <strong>grip</strong>ped it firmly in one hand and leveled it on her shoulder, then stood back and stared out across the water as if making careful calculations.</p>
<p><u>The glory of autumn had <strong>withered</strong> and fallen</u>, its traces <strong><u>scatter</u></strong>ed about the surface of the lake. The wind came in short, <strong><u>erratic</u></strong> bursts, now blowing, now quiet. Violet wet one mechanical finger with the tip of her tongue and held it up to test the wind’s direction. Oscar watched her <strong>fretfully</strong>.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Violet tensed. Her feet dug firmly into the ground with a <strong><u>crunch</u></strong>, and she turned to face Oscar bearing the slightest trace of a smile.</p>
<p>“Worry not. I’ll see to it that everything goes precisely as you have hoped.”</p>
<hr>
<h1 id="C1P7"><a href="#C1P7" class="headerlink" title="[C1P7]"></a>[C1P7]</h1><p>As the last of those words rang clearly through the air, Violet began to move forward. There had been quite some distance between her and the lake, but in the blink of an eye, she had already passed before Oscar’s. She seemed to quite literally be moving as fast as the wind.</p>
<p>At her final step before meeting the lake’s edge, the fleet-footed Auto Memories Doll kicked off with great force, <strong><u>gouging</u></strong> out marks in the earth where she had made this final escape from land. Her powerful legs lifted her unbelievably high into the air, and for a moment, it seemed as if she might just continue on her way up the stairway to heaven. Oscar’s mouth fell open as he observed her <strong><u>unworldly</u></strong> movements. Everything seemed to be happening in slow motion.</p>
<p>On reaching the peak of her great leap, Violet raised her hand and the umbrella it had been holding high above her head. The <strong><u>canopy</u></strong> sprang open suddenly, like a flower blooming in the sky. The frills along its edge wavered <strong><u>enchantingly</u></strong>.</p>
<p>As if on cue, the wind picked up again and swept Violet and her umbrella across the sky.</p>
<p>The umbrella –and Violet’s skirt– <strong><u>billow</u></strong>ed gently while drifting downward. Here and there were flashes of white <strong><u>petticoat</u></strong>. At long last, the tip of Violet’s personal, <strong><u>meticulously</u></strong> kept lace-up boot touched gently against one leaf floating on the water.</p>
<p>That moment. That instant. That single frame. The clear image burned into Oscar’s <strong><u>retinae</u></strong> with such precision it was as if he’d snapped a photograph after all. The arc of the umbrella, the fluttering of the skirt, the girl with her foot arched against the face of the lake. It was the work of a <strong><u>sorceress</u></strong>. To Oscar’s mind came the fateful day which had stopped his daughter’s heart, and the words his daughter had spoken to him then:</p>
<p>“Someday.”</p>
<p><em>Someday I’ll dance for you. On the lake, by our home now far away. When the leaves <strong>drift</strong> across the water in autumn.</em></p>
<p>“Someday.”</p>
<p><em>Someday I’ll dance for you.</em></p>
<p>“Father.”</p>
<p>That voice. Her voice. He thought he’d lost it long ago, but there it was, echoing through his mind. <em>You never knew it, but I’d wanted so badly to hear you call out to me. Another thousand times wouldn’t have been enough.</em></p>
<p>“Someday I’ll dance for you.”</p>
<p><em>“Father,” you’d say.</em></p>
<p><em>In that sweet, frail voice.</em></p>
<p>“Someday I’ll dance for you, Father.”</p>
<p><em>Your voice was more soothing to my ears than any music.</em></p>
<p>“Someday I’ll dance for you.”</p>
<p><em>Yes, that’s just how it was. Just like that. With that voice. Trying in perfect innocence to bring a smile to my face. That’s how you said it.</em></p>
<p><em>I’d forgotten your promise. I’d forgotten all about it. It’s been a long time–so very, very long–since I’ve been able to remember you. I’m so happy to see you again. To see you again… even if only as a dream. My darling. My daughter. My… My… …My one and only treasure, shared between my love and me.</em></p>
<p><em>You must have known that you could never keep it. And yet you made your promise to me. That promise… your death… it <strong><u>withered</u></strong> me away into what I am now, and yet it let me live on. It stretched my life out this far. I <strong><u>stumbled</u></strong> onward, searching for a trace of you. And though I did so always full of regret, I have been granted this one instant. It is not you. But in that one instant, for me, she was you.</em></p>
<p><em>One fleeting moment of <strong><u>serendipity</u></strong>, of reunion, of embrace. I’d wanted so badly to see this moment. Perhaps that is what kept me alive.</em></p>
<p><em>You, whose name I had not even been able to <strong><u>mournfully</u></strong> whisper. I’d waited so long to see you. One more time, my darling. The last family left to me. Oh, how I’d waited. So long I had missed you. I loved you.</em></p>
<p>Heavy with joy, he wanted to smile.</p>
<p>“…Ohh… Ohh…” Only sobs escaped his lips.</p>
<p>Tears streamed down Oscar’s face as if pushing themselves back into motion after having been frozen to a standstill.</p>
<p>“…Ahhh… I can’t…”</p>
<p>The tick-tock sound of a clock’s hands came to his ears. His newly <strong><u>thaw</u></strong>ed heart drummed loudly.</p>
<p>“…so much… so much…”</p>
<p>He raised his hands to cover his face and <strong><u>flinched</u></strong> when he found them to be full of wrinkles. How long had time been stopped for him since those two passed?</p>
<p>“Oh, how I wish you hadn’t died…”</p>
<p>He whispered in a voice mixed with sobs, his face a twisted mess.</p>
<p>“That you’d stayed alive… stayed alive and grown up to be big…”</p>
<p><em>I wanted to see you, grown into a beautiful young woman. I wanted to see you like that. I wanted to see it with my own eyes. Then I should have been the one to die first. Before you. In the end cared for by you. That’s how I should have wanted to die. Not me caring for you at your end. Not how we had it.</em></p>
<p>“Oh, how I miss you…!”</p>
<p>Oscar’s eyes overflowed with tears. They rolled down his cheeks before falling to the ground in large drops.</p>
<p>And <u>into this tear-streaked world</u> <em>tore</em> the crashing sound of Violet sinking into the lake.</p>
<p>Oscar’s brief, <u>glittering</u> moment went dark; just as quickly as it had returned, the sound of his daughter’s voice was lost to him once more.</p>
<p>The image of her smile, too, fled from his mind like a soap bubble suddenly burst.</p>
<p>Oscar had blocked out the world with the palms of his hands. Now he squeezed his eyes shut in further refusal. He tried desperately to cut off this world in which she was lost.</p>
<p><em>Ah, it would be better for me to die here and now. No matter how long I mourn, they will never return. My heart, my breath, I beg of you to stop. My wife and my daughter are dead, and since they have left, life has been as death for me, too. So now, in this moment, I should like to have a bullet pierce me through.</em></p>
<p><em>Like a flower, which can no longer live on once stripped of its <strong><u>petals</u></strong>. But this prayer repeated a hundred million times yet does not come true. I know, for already have I prayed a hundred million times.</em></p>
<hr>
<h1 id="C1P8"><a href="#C1P8" class="headerlink" title="[C1P8]"></a>[C1P8]</h1><p><em>Let me die. Let me die. Let me die. If you would leave me to live alone, rather I would die and be together. Not once had prayer alone brought blessings to him. Not even once!</em></p>
<p>“Sir!”</p>
<p>From the other side, from that shut out world, he heard a voice. It came from someone living in the same time as him. The voice was out of breath and drawing nearer.</p>
<p><em>I’m… alive. I’m still alive. And with that life, I’m fighting to preserve, in some form, the ones I’ve loved and lost.</em></p>
<p>Nothing is granted for prayer alone, but for Oscar, confronted by darkness which no light could pierce, to prayer was where he turned.</p>
<p>“…O, God, please.”</p>
<p><em>If I may not die now, then please, at least in the pages of my story, let that girl be happy. Let her be delighted by my tale. And let her be by my side. Let her be by my side for eternity. Even if only in that story. Even if as but an imaginary daughter. Please, let her be by my side.</em></p>
<p>These things he had to beg.</p>
<p>For in the meantime, his own life continued to stretch on.</p>
<p>Oscar <strong><u>bawled</u></strong> in a manner <strong><u>unbecoming</u></strong> of his age. Before him appeared Violet, <strong><u>drenched</u></strong> head to toe after having dragged herself out of the lake. Water streamed off from her, and her carefully chosen outfit hung <strong><u>limp</u></strong> and ruined.</p>
<p>But Violet herself seemed to be having more fun than she’d ever had before. One might have even thought the expression on her face worthy of being called a smile.</p>
<p>“Were you able to see it? I believe it was three whole steps.”</p>
<p><em>I couldn’t see anything for all the tears</em>, Oscar couldn’t bring himself to say.</p>
<p>So instead, while trying to sniff away his running nose, he answered, “Yes.”</p>
<p>“Yes, I saw you. Thank you, Violet Evergarden.”</p>
<p>He uttered the words with heartfelt respect and gratitude.</p>
<p>“Thank you for making my dream come true. Thank you. I feel as though I’ve witnessed a miracle. I do not believe there is a God, but if there is, surely it must be you.”</p>
<p>Violet looked at him.</p>
<p>“I am an Auto Memories Doll, sir.”</p>
<p>She answered duly, neither denying nor affirming the existence of God.</p>
<p>After that, Oscar drew a bath for Violet, who was completely drenched.</p>
<p>She refused to show herself during meals. But every day she took a bath, and almost certainly she used the bedroom he was providing her to rest herself at night.</p>
<p>She seemed very much human for being an <u>automaton</u>.</p>
<p><em>Modern civilization is quite truly a wonder. And the advances of science are quite remarkable.</em></p>
<p>It just wasn’t proper to let a girl sit around in wet clothes, even if she were mechanical. Having figured she’d need something to change into, Oscar picked up one of his own bathrobes, which he thought reasonably clean, and headed toward the bathroom. It had been so long since he’d had anyone else in the house using the bath that to knock on the door completely slipped his mind. He walked right in to find her not yet changed.</p>
<p>“A… ah, s… so… rr… y? Huh?”</p>
<p>Oscar was so overwhelmed he could hardly find words.</p>
<p>“…What on earth?!”</p>
<p>The image of the naked woman coursed through Oscar’s eyes. She was far more <strong><u>captivating</u></strong>, far more beautiful than any of the Renaissance <strong><u>nude</u></strong>s.</p>
<p>Drips fell <strong><u>anew</u></strong> from her golden locks, these of bathwater. Her eyes sparkled that perfect blue which no brush would ever capture.</p>
<p>Below them, her full lips, her delicate neck, her prominent <strong><u>collarbone</u></strong>, her round breasts, the feminine curves of her figure… In contrast, the artificial arms that extended from shoulder to fingertip on both sides of her body seemed alien, as if they’d just been stuck on.</p>
<p>But everything else.</p>
<p>Though covered in scars, every inch aside from those arms was clearly of flesh and blood.</p>
<p>Every soft swell of her body told the story. This was no automaton, no doll–this was a human being. In the utter shock of his shattered beliefs, Oscar found his eyes scanning her naked form again and again.</p>
<p>“…Sir.”</p>
<p>Violet’s tone was harsh. Oscar, who had until now stood frozen in surprise with those eyes locked on her form, finally seemed to grasp the entirety of the situation he’d put himself in.</p>
<p>“Ahhh! Aaaaaaaaahhhh! AaaaaaaaaaAaaaaaaahhh!!!”</p>
<p>Ironically, after all this, the only scream to be heard came from Oscar himself.</p>
<p>After all but emptying his lungs with the scream, Oscar, both red in the face and seemingly half to tears, demanded of Violet, “You were human all along?”</p>
<p>Violet was wrapping a towel around herself as she answered. “Sir, you are really quite impossible.”</p>
<p>As she uttered these words softly, with a slightly lowered gaze, there appeared the slightest touch of rose in her cheeks.</p>
<p>“The Auto Memories Doll.”</p>
<p>Some time had passed since that term was all the rage. The first one was created by Dr. Orlando, the world’s authority on automatons. It all began when his wife Molly, a novelist, complained of her clouding vision. Molly, having devoted most of her life to her words, was crestfallen as they faded away from her. Once reduced to blindness, it seemed as if her strength also was wasting away.</p>
<p>Dr. Orlando could not bear to see his dear wife this way, and as such he devised the Auto Memories Doll. It was a contraption capable of recording a person’s spoken words: a “borrowed pen,” as it were.</p>
<p>Some of Molly’s following works would even go on to win <strong><u>prestigious</u></strong> literary awards of worldwide renown. Dr. Holland’s invention was praised as an absolute necessity to the course of history. Though at the time he’d meant it merely as a creation for his dearest, his model quickly spread, and soon such dolls were acting to support myriad other people. Thus, Auto Memories Dolls became widely known, even available for rental at a modest price.</p>
<p>…Add to that one more thing.</p>
<p>People–living, breathing people–also worked as scribes, just like the Auto Memories Dolls. In fact, they even shared the same name:</p>
<p>“Auto Memories Dolls.”</p>
<p>Oscar first heard about it from his friend, after Violet’s departure. Apparently Violet was quite well-known across the industry.</p>
<p>When Oscar revealed how he’d mistaken the woman for an automaton, his friend had had a great laugh. When the man finally contained himself, he looked at Oscar with an exasperated look on his face and said, “You really have been away from the world too long.”</p>
<p>“Hah! A machine looking like that. Can you even imagine?”</p>
<p>“How was I supposed to know? You all kept saying, ‘Automaton this, automaton that!’”</p>
<p>“Our technology isn’t <em>that</em> far advanced. It’s just that we have ones that are actual automatons, too. They’re a bit more… <strong><u>quaint</u></strong> than Violet. Figured that wasn’t quite what an isolated shut-in like you needed. She doesn’t talk much, but she’s got some talent for fixing people up. Did a pretty good job with you, eh?”</p>
<p>“…Yeah.”</p>
<p>She was quiet, but yes. She was a very good girl.</p>
<p>“Tell you what. I’ll send along another scribe to help you with your writing for the time being. The non-human kind this time. Just don’t expect anything <strong><u>on par with</u></strong> Violet Evergarden.”</p>
<p>And, before long, a small package arrived at the lakeside house. Inside was a small doll, absolutely nothing like Violet Evergarden.</p>
<p>It wore an adorable little dress and sat quietly on top of Oscar’s desk. It was a little typewriting automaton that recorded all of his words and put them down onto paper. Certainly a remarkable device.</p>
<p>“Nothing like her, though.”</p>
<p>Oscar smiled wryly. Staring <strong><u>blankly</u></strong> at his room, he felt as though he could just make out the face of the scribe now gone.</p>
<p>“I miss you.” Had he said it aloud, he was sure her reply would come.</p>
<p>“Simply impossible, sir.”</p>
<p>In that clear, ringing voice.</p>
<p>Her lips revealing the slightest trace of a smile on her otherwise straight face.</p>
<p>Even without her at his side, he felt quite certain he could hear that voice.</p>

<p><strong><em>Violet Evergarden</em></strong> written by Akatsuki Kana</p>
<p>From the author: I’m writing this letter from the north. Snow Country is a place as quiet as the dead of night. Because of the cold outside, I grew into an adult who <strong>indulges</strong> in movies and stories when at home. I hope that the scenes here, drawn from my imagination, might float with you on your sea of words.</p>
<p><strong>Prologue: “The Auto Memories Doll”</strong></p>
<p>Some time has passed since this term was all the rage. The first one was created by Dr. Orlando, the world’s authority on automatons. It all began when his wife Molly, a novelist, complained of her clouding vision. Molly, having devoted most of her life to her words, was <strong>crestfallen</strong> as they faded away from her. Once reduced to blindness, it seemed as if her strength also was wasting away. Dr. Orlando could not bear to see his dear wife this way, and as such he devised the Auto Memories Doll. It was a <strong>contraption</strong>capable of recording a person’s spoken words: a “borrowed pen,” as it were. At the time, the doctor had meant it merely a creation for his dearest, but the model quickly spread, and soon such dolls were acting to support <strong>myriad</strong> other people. Today Auto Memories Dolls are widely known, even available for rental at a modest price.</p>

<p>Chapter 1: “The Novelist and the Doll”</p>
<p>Roswell was a city of green, <strong><u>ensconced</u></strong> in the beauty of nature. It bared itself among the foothills of tall mountains. Among those of ample resource, Roswell was known as a summer <strong><u>retreat</u></strong>; a town of villas and cottages, homes away from home.</p>
<p>In spring, the landscapes burst with flowers, bringing light to their admirers’ eyes. In summer, hikers there sought a moment of respite beside the city’s famed waterfall, well-loved for ages. In autumn, the rain of leaves softened the heart, and in winter the world itself was <strong><u>bestowed</u></strong> a mute <strong><u>tranquility</u></strong>. Each season’s flourish on stage was distinct; it was a land <strong><u>magnanimous</u></strong> upon the eyes of visitors at any time of year.</p>
<p>Vacation homes throughout the town formed a <strong><u>swatch</u></strong> of <strong><u>variegated</u></strong> wooden rooftops, both big and small. Land there was not cheap. Simply owning a home in Roswell was a sufficient sign of affluence.</p>
<p>In the city’s heart, countless shops courted one main throughway and catered to endless tourists. During holidays, this corridor was inevitably thronged with shoppers, and the people created a fabric of <strong><u>cacophony</u></strong> appropriate to city life, each weaving his happy <strong><u>bustle</u></strong> into the song of the street. The wares set out were nothing to <strong><u>scoff</u></strong> at–far from so, in fact, given the town’s remote location.</p>
<p>Most residents of Roswell sought convenience and so built their villas in the city proper. Those who settled elsewhere were the town eccentrics.</p>
<p>It was now autumn in Roswell. <strong><u>Cirrocumulus</u></strong> <strong><u>wafted</u></strong> in <strong><u>ripples</u></strong> high up in the sky. Far removed from the <strong><u>foothills</u></strong> was a small lake, an almost forgotten stop along the town’s busy tourist circuit. One small cottage stood quietly by its waters.</p>
<p>Viewed with kindness, it was a vintage home bearing a distinguished <strong><u>facade</u></strong>. To less forgiving eyes, the house was a monument to disrepair, long abandoned by human hands. One first had to pass under its arched gates, white now only by virtue of their long companionship with the sun. From there, a short path led through a garden buried in weeds and nameless flowers. Finally, at the path’s end, the home itself came into view.</p>
<p>The red brick walls were in such decay that one could only conclude the owner had no intent of ever patching them. Here and there a roof tile was split, once-orderly ranks now cruelly dismembered.</p>
<p>Immediately next to the entrance, vines had coiled themselves in knots about a swing, ensuring that it would swing no more. It was both evidence of a child and evidence that the child was certainly here no longer.</p>
<p>The owner of the house was a man in the prime of life. His name was Oscar.</p>
<p>He was a screenwriter working without <strong><u>pretense</u></strong> of <strong><u>nom de plume</u></strong>. His hair was red with a curl, and his black-rimmed glasses could hardly contain the thick lenses with which they had been charged. Oscar’s back was slightly <strong><u>hunched</u></strong>, but his face was fresh, lending him an air of youthfulness belying his real age. Sensitive to the cold, he was never without a sweater. All in all, Oscar was an unremarkable man, hardly seeming fit to be the hero of any story.</p>
<p>To Oscar, this house was not a villa. Quite simply, Roswell was home, and it was in this house that Oscar lived.</p>
<p>It was built to house not him alone, but also his wife and young daughter. The rooms had been quite spacious for three, but now they were used by only one. Oscar lived alone. Both his wife and child had already departed for the other world.</p>
<p>The wife had <strong><u>succumbed</u></strong> to an illness with a name so <strong><u>meandering</u></strong> it was hard to even remember.</p>
<p>To put it simply, her blood had <strong><u>coagulated</u></strong> in her veins, blocking them. Death quickly followed. The condition was genetic. Her father, too, had suffered that fate.</p>
<p>Oscar had known his wife was an orphan. He’d heard her <strong><u>plaintive</u></strong> story of the many from her family who had died young. But it was not until after she died that he grasped the true reason for this.</p>
<p>At the funeral, her close friend had <strong><u>confided</u></strong> in Oscar. “She was frightened. She thought if it were known, no one would ever want to marry her. So she kept it hidden.” When the words hit Oscar’s ears, only one thought echoed through his mind: “Why?”</p>
<p>“Why? Why? Why?”</p>
<p><em>All you had to do was say it. You could have shared anything with me.</em></p>
<p><em>There’s so much we could have done. We could have searched together for a cure. We had all this useless excess of money to throw at it.</em></p>
<p>It was clear that Oscar’s wife had not married him for his money. They’d met before his break as a screenwriter. She was a librarian at the library he frequented. And in any case, it was Oscar himself who first began to stare.</p>
<p><em>How pretty</em>, he’d thought.</p>
<p><em>And she’s the one in charge of the new arrivals corner. It always has such good books.</em></p>
<p>As he fell in love with her books, so too did he fall in love with her.</p>
<p>“Why?” The question echoed some hundred million times. It buaround his mind, then finally vanished.</p>
<p>His wife’s friend was an accomplished woman. While Oscar’s heart <strong><u>floundered</u></strong> in the wake of loss, she worked vigorously to attend to the young daughter who had been left in Oscar’s care. Left to himself, the man would go all day without eating, so she brought warm food to their home. The girl, in turn, sobbed for her missing mother, so with her she sat, gently tying the girl’s hair in braids as her mother used to do.</p>
<p>Perhaps, for a brief moment, there had been a spark of love between Oscar and this woman. Late one night, when Oscar’s daughter had been sick in bed with a fever and had suddenly begun to <strong><u>vomit</u></strong> uncontrollably, it was she who rushed the girl to the hospital. And it was she, not Oscar, who first learned that the girl was <strong><u>afflicted</u></strong> with the same <strong><u>ailment</u></strong>.</p>
<p>From there, the disease progressed gradually. But for Oscar, it was all much too fast.</p>
<hr>
<h1 id="C1P2"><a href="#C1P2" class="headerlink" title="[C1P2]"></a>[C1P2]</h1><p>Desperate to avoid a repeat of their recent tragedy, Oscar turned to the finest physicians from across the land. They moved from one great hospital to the next. Oscar implored each doctor they met, and through his appeals learned of a new, experimental treatment. The decision seemed an easy one.</p>
<p>Yet every herb has its <strong>demons</strong>. The girl <strong>clamored</strong> with each swallow, a sight which ate away at her <strong>doting</strong> father as the days of treatment stretched on.</p>
<p>The new treatment seemed to have no effect on her symptoms. Having no further recourse, the doctors declared it a lost cause and withdrew from the fight.</p>
<p>Oscar became <strong>plagued</strong> with the <strong>absurd</strong> notion that his lonely wife was <strong>beckon</strong>ing to their daughter from the world beyond. He <strong>wailed</strong> at her grave, “Don’t take her from me!” But the dead speak no words.</p>
<p>Oscar was <strong>teetering</strong> on the edge. Perhaps unexpectedly, it was his wife’s friend who broke first. Exhausted by endless <strong>fret</strong>ting as the girl <strong>hung in limbo</strong>, she appeared less and less often at the hospital, then finally stopped coming altogether. Oscar and his daughter were now truly alone. The girl’s extensive medication had left her <strong>emaciated</strong>. Her once-milky skin was a sickly yellow and her once-rosy cheeks <strong>pallid</strong>.</p>
<p>Her honeyed hair, too, was now falling out.</p>
<p>Oscar could no longer bear to look at her.</p>
<p>After endlessly pushing fruitless questions upon the doctors, he finally <strong>relent</strong>ed. The girl would continue on <strong>analgesics</strong> alone. All other treatment would stop. Oscar resolved that if nothing else, his daughter’s short life would not end in suffering.</p>
<p>The next while was peaceful. They spent happy days together. He saw his daughter smile for the first time in months. So continued their last few days of light.</p>
<p>It was glorious autumn outside on the day that she died. Color was slipping from the world drip by drip, but the sky was bright blue and cloudless. From the window, one caught <strong>candid</strong> glimpses of trees dressed in reds and yellows. A fountain stood in the hospital grounds, offering <strong>respite</strong> to the <strong>weary</strong>. Fallen leaves floated soundlessly across its pool.</p>
<p>Each leaf there had fallen to the water’s surface and <strong>drifted</strong> there until finally pulled into a <strong>clump</strong> of <strong>comrade</strong>s. Now they floated aimlessly together. New leaves were always pulled in, almost as if by magnet. Thus, even in their <strong>wreckage</strong>, lives lost to the season, they emerged in beautiful <strong>synchronization</strong>.</p>
<p>On seeing them, the girl spoke. “How pretty.</p>
<p>“The way the water’s blue and the color of the leaves mix together. It’s so pretty. Father, if a person stepped on those leaves, do you think they’d walk across the pond without falling in?”</p>
<p>Ah, the innocence of a child. Surely gravity and weight would conspire to bring one’s body plunging in, but Oscar could deny his daughter no more.</p>
<p>“And if you held an umbrella, my sweet, you could use the wind and perhaps even float just above it.”</p>
<p>His tone was playful. He longed so badly to dote on his helpless daughter just a little more. And as she listened to his words, her eyes sparkled. “Yes. Yes, that’s just what I’ll do. I’ll dance across the water for you.”</p>
<p><em>Someday I’ll dance for you. On the lake, by our home now far away. When the leaves drift across the water in autumn.</em></p>
<p>Shortly after, she fell into a coughing fit. One cough, two, then several more. And then, as if stolen away, she was gone.</p>
<p>She had been but nine years old.</p>
<p>When Oscar brought his arms under the <strong>husk</strong> she had left behind, it felt dreadfully light. Too light, even for a body now short a soul.</p>
<p>Had she ever even been alive? Had it just been one long dream? Tears came to his eyes.</p>
<p>The girl was buried alongside her mother. Oscar returned to the house built for three, and there he began his life of silence.</p>
<p>Oscar had financial means enough to live on without working. A royalty system brought in money each time his widely-used scripts were employed. He would never <strong>scrape</strong> the bottom of his savings, and he would never go hungry.</p>
<p>After several years of mourning for his wife and daughter, a long-lost work acquaintance reached out to Oscar. Wouldn’t he try his hand at one more script?</p>
<p>It was <strong>at the behest of</strong> an elite performing <strong>troupe</strong>, one which any actor would clamor to be a part of. For Oscar, whose past work was known but who had all but vanished from the industry, it was an honor simply to be asked.</p>
<p>He’d spent so many days <strong>languishing</strong> in <strong>sloth</strong>, <strong>wallowing</strong> in sadness, <strong>indulging</strong> in self-pity.</p>
<p>Man is a thing that tires. Whether happiness or sadness, he cannot bear to live always with that alone. That is how he is built.</p>
<p>Oscar agreed to the job in his second reply, determined to lift his pen once more.</p>
<p>But here the trouble began. In desperation to escape his <strong>harsh</strong> reality, Oscar had turned to–no, embraced–the bottle. And with it came a <strong>smattering</strong> of drugs to ensure happy thoughts at least in dreams. With the help of his doctor he had somehow managed to conquer the drink and drugs themselves, yet in their wake, his hands were left forever trembling.</p>
<p>Whether words laid on paper or struck with keys, his efforts to push forward seemed hopeless.</p>
<p>His breast was full with words; he merely needed to find the way to bring them forth.</p>
<p>He turned once more to his acquaintance to ask for advice.</p>
<p>“I’ve just the thing.</p>
<p>“We need to get you an Auto Memories Doll.”</p>
<p>“What’s that?”</p>
<p>“Ah, my friend, you’ve been away from the world too long… I’m worried about you. Auto Memories Dolls. Everybody knows about them. You can even rent them out. Hardly costs a thing anymore. Yes, that’s what we’ll do. I’ll have one sent over for you to try out.”</p>
<p>“I’m going to get help from a… doll?”</p>
<p>“Hah! A special kind of doll, to be sure.”</p>
<p>And that was how Oscar came to use a new kind of tool, one whose name he’d only just learned. Oscar and the “Auto Memories Doll.” This was the beginning of their fates <strong>entwined</strong>.</p>
<hr>
<h1 id="C1P3"><a href="#C1P3" class="headerlink" title="[C1P3]"></a>[C1P3]</h1><p>A woman made her way up the mountain path.</p>
<p>Her bangs hung freely. <strong><u>Braids</u></strong> laced the crown of her head, held together with a ribbon of deep, <strong><u>velvety</u></strong> red. Her slender frame was wrapped in a snowy white summer dress tied at the waist.</p>
<p>The dress’ silk, <strong><u>pleated</u></strong> skirt <strong><u>fluttered</u></strong> <strong><u>angelically</u></strong> with each step she took. The <u>emerald</u> <strong><u>brooch</u></strong> <strong><u>affix</u></strong>ed at her <strong><u>bosom</u></strong>&lt;/u&gt; <u><strong>sparkled</strong></u>.</p>
<p>Over the dress, she wore a <strong><u>sleek</u></strong>, Prussian blue jacket. Her long boots had deepened into a cocoa brown with age. And on this day, as she passed under the white arch of Oscar’s home, she held in her hand a heavy-looking <strong><u>trunk</u></strong>.</p>
<p>Just as the woman stepped into the front garden, a <strong><u>gust</u></strong> of autumn wind <strong><u>bellowed</u></strong>, bringing red, yellow, and brown leaves <strong><u>swirling</u></strong> about her in dancing rings. Her vision seemed to <strong><u>falter</u></strong>, as if these swirling <strong><u>remnants</u></strong> of autumn had pulled a curtain down before her. She reached a hand to the brooch affixed at her breast, squeezed it tight, and <strong><u>intoned</u></strong> in a low voice some words that were <strong><u>eclipse</u></strong>d by those wings of autumn as they continued to flutter excitedly. Having reached no ears, the spoken words melted away into space.</p>
<p>When the <strong><u>mischievous</u></strong> wind died down, the woman seemed to set aside her recent display of uncertainty. She continued on to the entryway with purpose. There she pressed on the buzzer with one finger of a hand <strong><u>encased</u></strong> in black glove.</p>
<p>The house’s bell <strong><u>reverberated</u></strong> like a screech escaped from hell. A moment later, the door opened. The house’s red-haired owner <strong><u>peer</u></strong>ed out from the gap. It was hard to tell whether he’d just woken up or whether he’d not slept at all. In either case, he was clearly in no state to be receiving guests. His clothing and face were both <strong><u>disheveled</u></strong>. On seeing the woman, Oscar let slip a slight look of surprise. He seemed to have <strong><u>been taken aback</u></strong> by the woman’s most <strong><u>peculiar</u></strong> appearance.</p>
<p>Or perhaps he had been caught off guard by her singular beauty. Whatever the case, he found himself, for a moment, short of breath.</p>
<p>“You’re… the ‘Auto Memories Doll’?”</p>
<p>“That is correct. Please inform me of any assistance you might require, and I will be happy to oblige. Auto Memories Doll Violet Evergarden, at your service.”</p>
<p>The storybook blonde-haired, blue-eyed beauty spoke these words with no trace of <strong><u>obsequiousness</u></strong>. Rather, they <strong><u>emanated</u></strong> from her lips with the deep clarity of a well-polished gemstone.</p>
<p>The woman who had identified herself as Violet Evergarden carried herself in quiet beauty, the very <strong>essence</strong> of a doll. Her blue eyes, <u>lace</u>d by eyelashes of golden thread, sparkled with the mysteries of the seabed. From the milk-white skin of her cheek blushed the <strong><u>splendor</u></strong> of cherry petals at their peak. Her <strong><u>rouge-tinted lips</u></strong> <strong><u>glistened</u></strong> invitingly.</p>
<p>Nothing about her was lacking. <u>Her beauty was as full as the moon at its peak.</u></p>
<p>Had she not blinked, one would have thought she was a static work of art.</p>
<p>Oscar knew nothing about Auto Memories Dolls. The arrangements for Violet’s arrival had been handled entirely by the same friend who had convinced Oscar to take on this new writing job.</p>
<p>“It’ll be delivered in a few days,” he’d said.</p>
<p>And here she was at last.</p>
<p>From the way his friend spoke, Oscar had assumed some small package would arrive at his door, care of the postman. He’d open up the box and inside would be a small, mechanical doll. He was hardly prepared for this thing so lifelike, this… <strong><u>automaton</u></strong>.</p>
<p><em>How far has civilization progressed while I’ve <u>holed myself up</u> here?</em></p>
<p>Oscar had never shown particular interest in any of the ways of the world. He read no newspapers or magazines, and he rarely socialized. If it weren’t for the friends who showed concern for him, perhaps his only interaction would have been with the deliveryman from the grocer’s.</p>
<p>Already Oscar was regretting his hasty decision. Clearly he should have spent more time looking into the matter of the doll before giving his consent. The mere thought of having another person in the house meant only for that long-lost family of three did not sit well with him. It was like an unpleasant aftertaste. Another person… or something that resembled one, anyway.</p>
<p>Oscar felt as if he were somehow betraying his family.</p>
<p>Violet, perfectly unaware of any of these thoughts <u>swirling</u> about Oscar’s head, followed him into the living room and set herself down on the sofa when invited. When Oscar offered her tea, she drank it. These modern automatons seemed to be quite advanced.</p>
<p>“What happens to the tea after you drink it?”</p>
<p>Sensing Oscar’s tone of disbelief, Violet gently tipped her head to one side as she answered. “Ultimately it is discharged from my body, after which I believe it returns to the Earth.”</p>
<p>An answer befitting of a machine.</p>
<p>“To tell the truth… I’m at a bit of a loss right now. You’re a bit… different from what I expected.”</p>
<p>Violet glanced down as if to confirm her own appearance, then abruptly stood up from the sofa and returned Oscar’s stare.</p>
<p>“Is there something about me which does not meet your expectations?”</p>
<p>“Uh… well, it’s not exactly my expectations…”</p>
<p>“If the additional wait would not inconvenience you, I can arrange for the <strong><u>dispatch</u></strong> of a different doll, one more suitable to your needs.”</p>
<p>“Ah, no… that’s not what I’m trying to say. Uh, well… let’s just try this out, I suppose. If you can do the work, that’s all that matters. You seem un<strong><u>obtrusive</u></strong> enough.”</p>
<p>“If it pleases you, I will restrict my respiration to the minimally required level.”</p>
<p>“Ah, no, that won’t be necessary.”</p>
<hr>
<h1 id="C1P4"><a href="#C1P4" class="headerlink" title="[C1P4]"></a>[C1P4]</h1><p>“I have been dispatched here to fulfill your need for a scribe. I will perform my duties to your utmost satisfaction so as to not sully the Auto Memories Doll name. It matters not whether my tools are pen and paper or typewriter. Please make use of me as planned.”</p>
<p>Violet uttered these words with her large, jewel-like eyes affixed firmly on Oscar’s. It made Oscar feel a bit <strong>fidgety</strong>, but he managed to answer with an awkward nod.</p>
<p>The doll had been requested for a period of two weeks. They had only that much time to complete one full script.</p>
<p>Oscar composed himself and led Violet into his study, intending to begin work immediately.</p>
<p>However, on arrival there, it became clear that Violet’s first duties would not be as a scribe but as a housekeeper.</p>
<p>Oscar had pulled everything necessary into one room for it to double as both an office and a bedroom. <strong>Strewn</strong> about the floor were dirtied clothes and dishes filled with half-eaten meals. It was a miserable <strong>spectacle</strong>. Such was the mess that one could hardly find space to walk across the floor.</p>
<p>Violet remained silent as she again trained her blue eyes upon Oscar. The eyes themselves seemed to accuse. <em>Did you do anything at all to prepare for my arrival?</em></p>
<p>“…I’m sorry.”</p>
<p>Oscar himself knew that it was not a room befitting a working man. Since beginning his days alone, Oscar had hardly touched the living room. As a result, that room had remained in quite a <strong>presentable</strong> state. But the <strong>well-trodden</strong> rooms of his house–this office, the washroom, and the bathroom–had all fallen into a most <strong>wretched</strong> state.</p>
<p>He suddenly felt quite grateful that Violet was an automaton.</p>
<p>Her physical appearance suggested a young woman at the twilight of her teens, or perhaps in her early twenties. Oscar could think of any number of other torturous things he would prefer to endure than the situation of having to show a real girl of that age this embarrassment of an office. It was un<strong>chivalrous</strong>, and Oscar’s advancing years were no excuse.</p>
<p>“Sir, I must respectfully remind you that I am here to act as a scribe, not as a maid.”</p>
<p>Yet even as she spoke, Violet pulled from her trunk a white, frilled apron and began cleaning the room with a certain zeal. Thus passed their first day.</p>
<p>On the second, they finally managed to both seat themselves in the office and set about the real work ahead.</p>
<p>To be more precise, Oscar reclined on the bed, and Violet sat in the office’s lone chair. She rested her hands on the typewriter stationed at the desk.</p>
<p>“She spoke–”</p>
<p>As Oscar began to dictate his story, Violet’s hands moved over the keys with a flurry of speed. Her strokes were yet quiet, and of course performed perfectly from memory. Oscar’s eyes grew wide with surprise.</p>
<p>“You’re quite… fast, aren’t you?”</p>
<p>On receiving the compliment, Violet rolled up her sleeve and removed the black glove from one hand. She held the exposed arm up for Oscar to see. It ticked and whirred. A completely mechanical arm. The fingers and knuckles were of especially sturdy construction, finished with only a rudimentary coat of paint. “My parts have been chosen for maximum utility while still simulating human form. These were produced by Estark. They are renowned for their durability. They also boast a range of movement and compressive strength far exceeding that of human hands. They will suffice in allowing me to record your words precisely as you dictate.”</p>
<p>“Is that so… Uh, well, you don’t need to write down what I’m saying now. Just the words in the script.”</p>
<p>Oscar resumed his dictation. They took several breaks, but for the first day of writing, it seemed to go quite well.</p>
<p>Of course, he’d already had the play structured out somewhere in his mind. So far it had seemed quite easy to find the words.</p>
<p>And as he spoke, Oscar realized that Violet was a superb <strong>conduit</strong> and scribe. From the beginning, he’d noted her quiet appearance, and as they began to work she was every bit faithful to this impression. Though he hadn’t gone so far to ask it of her, he found that he really could not hear the sound of her breathing. The only sound at all in the room, besides Oscar’s own voice, was the click, clack of the typewriter. If he closed his eyes, it almost seemed as if he were pushing the keys himself. When he asked her to read back passages to check his progress, her voice was clear and perfectly <strong>inflected</strong>. Just listening to it was a joy.</p>
<p>Through her voice, every passage seemed a <strong>majestic</strong> tale.</p>
<p><em>So this is what has made them so popular.</em></p>
<p>He finally seemed to gain a deep appreciation for the qualities of the Auto Memories Doll.</p>
<p>But Oscar and Violet’s smooth progress halted abruptly on the fourth day. Several days passed without so much as a word written. Oscar was <strong>plagued</strong> with the writer’s most common <strong>affliction</strong>. Though the story seemed clear to him, the words would not spin together into the fabric they were meant to be.</p>
<p>Long years of experience had taught Oscar what he must do in this situation. The answer was simple: stop writing. He was of the firm belief that no great writing was born when forced.</p>
<p>He regretted having to make Violet wait.</p>
<p>Violet, for her part, quickly and seriously complied with requests for any other type of work around the house, from cleaning to cooking. She seemed to have been designed with, first and <strong>foremost</strong>, a hardworking disposition. It had been quite some time since Oscar had eaten a home-cooked meal, still <strong>wafting up steam</strong> on service. He’d had many a meal delivered and occasionally even went out to eat, but such foods somehow paled in comparison with a simple meal prepared through the labors of a well-meaning novice.</p>
<p>He ate unusual <strong>omelets</strong> whose every bite melted in his mouth. He ate a <strong>patty</strong> of hamburger mixed with tofu, presented on serving as “an exotic recipe carried from lands far to the East.” He ate fine <strong>pilafs</strong> of rice mixed with <strong>tangy</strong> sauces and flourishes of colorful vegetables. He ate seafood <strong>au gratin</strong>, a rare gem in this mountainous land. Violet inevitably balanced the meal with some sort of salad or soup on the side. Oscar was quite <strong>awed</strong> by it all.</p>
